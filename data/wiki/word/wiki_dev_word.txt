where the streets have no name 
where the streets have no name is a song by irish rock band u2 . 
it is the opening track from their album the joshua tree and was released as the album third single in august . 
the song hook is a repeating guitar using a delay effect , played during the song introduction and again at the end . 
lead vocalist bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person religion and income based on the street on which they lived , particularly in belfast . 
during the band difficulties recording the song , producer brian eno considered the song tapes to have them start from scratch . 
where the streets have no name was praised by critics and became a commercial success , peaking at number CD in the us , number CD in canada , number CD in the netherlands , and number CD in the united kingdom . 
the song has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in on the joshua tree tour . 
the song was performed on a los angeles for the filming of its music video , which won a grammy award for best performance music video . 
writing and recording 
the music for where the streets have no name originated from a demo that guitarist the edge composed the night before the group resumed the joshua tree sessions . 
in an upstairs room at house his newly purchased home the edge used a CD track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards , bass , guitar , and a drum machine . 
that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs , the edge wanted to up the ultimate u2 live song , so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future u2 show if he were a fan . 
after finishing the rough mix , he felt he had come up with the most amazing guitar part and song of his life . 
with no one in the house to share the demo with , the edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration . 
although the band liked the demo , it was difficult for them to record the song . 
adam clayton said , at the time it sounded like a foreign language , whereas now we understand how it works . 
the arrangement , with CD time signature shifts and frequent chord changes , was many times , but the group struggled to get a performance they liked . 
according to co producer daniel lanois , that was the science project song . 
i remember having this massive schoolhouse , as we call them . 
i was holding a pointer , like a college professor , walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking . 
it was ridiculous . 
co producer brian eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of where the streets have no name . 
the band worked on a single take for weeks , but as eno explained , that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up . 
through all of their work , they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance . 
so much time had been spent on work that eno thought it would be best to start from scratch . 
his idea was to stage an accident and have the song tapes erased . 
he said that this was not to force abandonment of the song , but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance . 
at CD point , eno had the tapes up and ready to be recorded over , but this never took place according to engineer flood , fellow engineer pat mccarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing eno ready to erase the tapes , dropped the of tea he was carrying and physically restrained eno . 
the studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes . 
it was CD of several songs mixed by steve in the final months of recording the joshua tree . 
drummer larry mullen , jr. later said of the song , it took so long to get that song right , it was difficult for us to make any sense of it . 
it only became a truly great song through playing live . 
on the record , musically , it not half the song it is live . 
composition 
where the streets have no name is played at a tempo of beats per minute . 
the introduction and are played in a time signature , while the remainder of the song is in a common signature . 
the songs opens with an instrumental section , starting with like sustained notes . 
the guitar fades in after seconds this part consists of a repeated CD note . 
a dotted eighth delay effect is used to play each note in the twice , thus creating a rich sound . 
the bass and drums enter at . 
the introduction , following a i iv i iv vi v i chord progression , creates a wall of sound , as described by mark butler , against which the vocals emerge after nearly CD minutes . 
the guitar part played for the remainder of the song features the edge strumming sixteenth notes . 
the bass and drums continue in regular eighth and sixteenth notes , respectively , while bono vocal performance , in contrast , varies greatly in its , he he he he he allows his voice to crack as well as timing by his usage of to slightly offset the notes he sings from the beat . 
this development reaches a climax during the first chorus at the line burning down love a g f d the melody progresses through a series of scale degrees that lead to the highest note in the song , the at burning . 
in later choruses , bono sings blown by the wind with the same melody , stretching the same note even longer . 
after the third chorus , the song is played , the instrumentation reverting to the same state as it was in the introduction , with a CD note guitar played against sustained notes . 
lyrics 
the lyrics were inspired by a story that bono heard about the streets of belfast , northern ireland , where a person religion and income are evident by the street they live on . 
he contrasted this with the he felt when visiting ethiopia , saying : the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren t such divisions , a place where the streets have no name . 
to me , that the way a great rock n roll concert should be a place where everyone comes together . maybe that the dream of all art to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all . 
bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to ethiopia with his wife , ali hewson he first wrote them down on an bag while staying in a village . 
according to him , the song is ostensibly about , elevation , whatever you want to call it . 
bono , who compared many of his lyrics prior to the joshua tree to sketches , said that where the streets have no name is more like the u2 of old than any of the other songs on the lp , because it a sketch i was just trying to sketch a location , maybe a spiritual location , maybe a romantic location . 
i was trying to sketch a feeling . 
the open ended nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretations . 
journalist michael campbell believed the lyrics send a message of hope and wish for a world that is not divided by class , wealth , race , or any other arbitrary criterion . 
with regard to the place bono was referring to in the song , he said , i m not sure , really , about that . 
i used to think it was belfast : journalist niall stokes believes the title was influenced by bono and his wife ali visit to ethiopia as volunteer aid workers . 
bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open ended lyrics i can look at it now and recognize that the song has CD of the most couplets in the history of pop music . 
but it also contains some of the biggest ideas . 
in a curious way , that seems to work . 
if you get any way heavy about these things , you don t communicate . 
but if you flip or about it , then you do . 
that CD of the i ve come to terms with .

the raid on manila of january was a royal navy false flag military operation during the french revolutionary wars intended to scout the strength of the defences of manila , capital of the spanish philippines , capture a manila galleon and assess the condition of the spanish navy squadron maintained in the port . 
spain had transformed from an ally of great britain in the war of the first coalition into an enemy in . 
thus the presence of a powerful spanish squadron at manila posed a threat to the china fleet , an annual convoy of east merchant ships from in qing dynasty china to britain , which was of vital economic importance to britain . 
so severe was this threat that a major invasion of the spanish philippines had been planned from british india during , but had been called off following the treaty of in europe and the possibility of a major war in india between the british east india company and the kingdom of mysore . 
to ensure the safety of the merchant ships gathering at in the winter of , the british commander in the east indies , rear admiral peter , sent a convoy to china escorted by the frigates hms and hms fox and commanded by captain edward cooke . 
after completing his mission cooke decided to investigate the state of readiness of spanish forces in manila himself . 
he was also intrigued by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from manila , which would make a valuable prize . 
in and accompanied by captain pulteney malcolm in fox , cooke reached the spanish capital on january . 
in manila bay , cooke pretended that his ships were french vessels and successfully lured successive of spanish officials aboard , taking them prisoner in turn . 
once he had determined from his captives the state of defences in manila , that the treasure ship had been at and that the spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations , he sent a raiding party against a squadron of gunboats in the mouth of the river . 
the gunboats in a bloodless attack , cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards , unsuccessfully assaulting before returning to . 
background 
in , after CD years of the french revolutionary wars , spain and the french republic signed the treaty of san . 
the secret terms of this treaty required spain to renounce its alliance with great britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally . 
in the east indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant british forces in the region were faced with the threat of attack from the spanish philippines to the east . 
britain dominated the east indies in , controlling the trade routes through the indian ocean from the ports of bombay , madras and calcutta . 
dutch ceylon , the dutch cape colony and parts of the dutch east indies had been captured in , and the french presence in the region had been confined to de france and a few subsidiary islands in the western indian ocean . 
some of the most important trade routes began at and in qing dynasty china . 
early in each year a large convoy known as the china fleet , composed of large east merchant ships in the employ of the british east india company , sailed to europe from laden with tea and other commercial cargo . 
this convoy was economically significant to britain CD convoy in was valued at over CD the equivalent of , , as of . 
in january the convoy had been attacked by the french squadron in the east indies , comprising CD frigates commanded by pierre césar charles de . 
in the ensuing strait incident the commander deceived into believing that the convoy contained disguised ships of the line and the french admiral retreated , only learning of his error on his return to de france . 
there was considerable concern in india that might try again in , or that the spanish , who maintained a powerful squadron at , might make an attempt of their own . 
initial impulse on learning in november of the impending declaration of war between britain and spain was to draw up plans for a major invasion of the philippines , centred on manila in repetition of the successful british capture of manila in . 
co operating with the governor general of india sir john shore and colonel arthur among others , a substantial naval and military forces were earmarked for the operation which was in the advance planning stages , when unexpected news arrived in india in august announcing the treaty of which brought the war of the first coalition to an end . 
britain now faced france and spain alone , while from the tipu sultan of the kingdom of mysore , an old opponent of britain in southern india , were seeking french assistance with a renewed outbreak of hostilities . 
the resources planned for the operation against manila were therefore retained in india and the operation cancelled , but the protection of the china fleet was still essential and diverted some of his squadron eastwards to china . 
a number of merchant ships had gathered at bombay in the spring of in preparation for the trip to to load trade goods and join the china fleet . 
to escort this force , provided the gun frigate hms , captured from the french at the battle of in , and the gun hms centurion , which sailed with the convoy in july , taking passage through the straits of , joined there by the ships of the line hms and hms and the gun frigate hms fox under captain pulteney malcolm for the final voyage to . 
the convoy arrived without incident on december , although the crews had been substantially weakened by tropical illnesses . 
cooke raids 
reconnaissance of 
with his convoy safely at anchor in and the china fleet several weeks from sailing , cooke decided to reconnoitre manila and make observations on the port and the spanish squadron based there . 
as an added motivation , rumours in suggested that the annual manila galleon was due to arrive . 
this ship brought up to CD CD spanish silver dollars from acapulco across the pacific ocean stopping at guam on its way to manila . 
its dollars in the philippines , the ship then loaded trade goods from the east indies for the return journey to new spain . 
this round trip was essential to the maintenance of the spanish empire in the east indies , which operated at an enormous financial loss only by the substantial subsidy from new spain . 
spanish dollars were the accepted currency across most of the east indies , and disruption of this financial system could have profound effects on regional trade but british sailors had nevertheless been attacking the manila since thomas in . 
leaving the heavier warships at , cooke sailed on january only with and fox , the latter carrying a mr. bernard , an experienced linguist . 
passing luzon , cooke ships encountered a small spanish merchant vessel , which was lured towards the frigates , which were flying french . 
the spanish vessel , cooke closely questioned the captain and learned that most of the spanish squadron in manila were undergoing extensive repairs at and were unfit to sail . 
cooke rewarded the captain by releasing his vessel with its cargo intact , although he did remove , silver dollars . 
the spanish squadron had suffered badly in a typhoon in april and much of the damage had still not been repaired by the time cooke small squadron arrived off manila . 
cooke had taken precautions to disguise his ships as french vessels , modelling on the powerful gun forte and fox on the smaller . 
on 
late in the afternoon of january , and fox arrived in manila bay , slipping past the fortress of and then sailing across the bay on the morning of january , anchoring between manila and . 
from his point cooke could see the spanish squadron dismasted and under repair in , the ships of the line san pedro , europa and and the frigates maria de la and in dock and unfit for action . 
to cooke disappointment he could also see the manila galleon , being at the docks and another valuable merchant ship rey carlos aground in the harbour . 
the spanish had learned only shortly before cooke arrival that the british frigate hms resistance under captain edward was in philippine waters and had decided to remove the valuable cargo from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack . 
fox was the first british ship into the anchorage , and was consequently approached by the , whose crew came aboard . 
malcolm , like cooke , spoke french and with bernard translating was able to persuade the officer in charge that the new were forte and seeking supplies and spanish reinforcements for commerce raiding operations . 
the officer offered supplies but cautioned that none of the spanish ships would be in a position to sail until march at the earliest . 
cooke then joined the party on the deck of fox , claiming to be commodore , a french officer who , unknown to the spanish , had been killed in the action of september off sumatra . 
the spanish officer was now completely convinced by the , which had been augmented by fake french uniforms . 
the visitor below decks , cooke then passed wine around and together they drank a series of , including the downfall of england . 
for an hour the officers drank , malcolm and cooke learning detailed information about the state of the defences and squadron in the philippines , until a second boat pulled alongside fox containing more officers keen to the french . 
this vessel was the personal barge of the spanish commander at , rear admiral don maría de , who was not aboard , but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat . 
each time , the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at and taken below decks as prisoners of war . 
in malcolm cabin , the captured officers were informed of their situation , promised release before the british frigates sailed , and offered more wine . 
the crew of fox meanwhile forced the captured spanish sailors to strip and their clothing . 
into the spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby river , where they had learned that CD heavy gunboats were moored . 
taking the crews by surprise , the british boarding parties drove off the spanish without a fight and brought all CD boats alongside fox . 
these vessels normally carried crews of CD and were well armed , CD with a pounder long gun and CD with pounder long guns , each supplemented by CD guns . 
the harbour captain reached fox shortly afterwards , furious at the seizure of the gunboats and demanding they be returned . 
malcolm received him with a of near incomprehensible french and brought him to join the other captured officers in his cabin , while the boat crew were imprisoned below decks . 
shortly afterwards , at , cooke and malcolm hosted a large dinner for their officer captives and sent food and to the crew , the total number of spanish sailors on fox now numbering approximately . 
once the meal was finished , cooke allowed all of the captives to return to their boats and row for shore without the conditions of parole , although he retained the captured gunboats . 
cooke led his small squadron past on january and turned south . 
CD days later in a storm CD of the gunboats broke its tow line and was never seen again , lost with its CD crew . 
the frigates subsequently scouted before reaching on january . 
there cooke raised spanish colours in an attempt to the authorities into supplying food and water to his squadron but grounded on a at the entrance to the port which raised the suspicions of a sent by the governor of , . 
the captain of the spanish boat asked the british ships the names of their captains , and on receiving no answer but a volley of rifle fire , he put the town on alert . 
with the defenders , cooke abandoned his and after the following morning , ordered a bombardment of the fort protecting the harbour . 
this had little effect , though later the spanish recovered at least from different , and malcolm then attempted an amphibious landing in order to storm the side of the fort . 
the boats came under heavy fire , CD smashed by a , killing CD and wounding CD . 
another boat grounded on a and became stuck so with his force in , as villagers armed with lances ambushed and drove the british from the beach , malcolm called off the operation . 
after exchanging shot for an hour both frigates cut their anchor cables and retreated out of range , with CD dead and one wounded on and CD wounded on fox , in addition to those lost in the boats . 
the defenders lost a single man killed and wounded . 
with his frigates now requiring repairs , cooke withdraw half a league from and spent CD days the masts and rigging of the ships . 
then he sailed north , scuttling the CD remaining gunboats as he did not believe they would survive the return journey to . 
CD days later , on january the squadron halted at a village named in the north of the sultanate of to collect fresh water . 
on the beach a boat party from was set upon by tribesmen . 
CD were killed and CD others taken captive and dragged into the forest before rescuers could arrive . 
cooke complained to sultan at and the captured sailors were eventually recovered , although not before and fox had sailed for china to escort the merchant convoy back to india . 
aftermath 
cooke opportunistic diversion had determined that the spanish forces in the philippines posed no immediate threat , although the mission had cost lives admiral later expressed his satisfaction with the outcome in a letter to the admiralty . 
more might have been achieved with reinforcements historian c. parkinson suggests that had cooke squadron united with resistance together they may have been able to destroy the disarmed spanish warships at . 
he also notes however that in this scenario would have been commanding officer , a man with considerably less imagination and than cooke . 
historian richard was critical of the mission , considering the operation to have no glorious outcome and citing the failure to capture the treasure ships as its greatest short coming . 
the china fleet sailed without further incident . 
during the ensuing year resistance was destroyed by an accidental explosion in july in the strait , and the majority of forces were focused on disrupting the french occupation of suez in the red sea . 
this diversion of british resources created gaps in the coverage in merchant shipping and was able to send the frigate and to manila late in the year to join the repaired spanish squadron . 
at the beginning of february , this combined force sailed to , taking the british defences by surprise . 
the british commander captain william , advancing on the franco spanish force which retreated during the day and disappeared under cover of darkness that evening in the archipelago . 
the combined squadron then dispersed and the china fleet was not attacked again until the battle of in , at which a french squadron was again driven off in confusion . 
the frigates cooke had mimicked , forte and were sent to operate independently against british trade in the indian ocean in early . 
was captured by hms at the action of february near southern africa , and forte was intercepted by hms under cooke on february near in bengal . 
in the ensuing battle forte was captured but cooke mortally wounded , dying on may .

CD . 
in february , manchester city council announced that the sculpture would be dismantled and placed in storage . 
despite the promise of storage and potential , the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal . 
the core was sold for scrap in july , while the spikes remain in storage . 
design and statistics

it was angled at degrees and supported by CD CD ft long , tapered steel legs which connected to the spikes CD ft above the ground . 
the sculpture weighed tonnes , with the concrete in the foundations weighing over , tonnes , including a m2 , sq ft reinforced concrete slab . 
the foundations are m ft deep . 
the sculpture was made from the same steel also known as CD as the angel of the north sculpture , which gradually develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements . 
this layer inhibits further corrosion by reducing its to water . 
as part of the design , the spikes slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts in excess of mph km h . 
at the time of construction a time capsule was placed in CD of the spikes of the sculpture , containing children poems and paintings , due to be opened circa . 
the location of the time capsule after is currently unknown . 
b of the bang was located next to the city of manchester stadium at , in , at the corner of alan turing way and ashton new road .

construction and funding 
the sculpture was constructed in sheffield by thomas studio , lucas , flint and and structures . 
it was approved at the start of , with the central core arriving in manchester on june . 
this was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory , and required a police escort . 
this central core was lifted into place in august , after which the spikes could begin being attached . 
early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of july , which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname g of the bang . 
the official unveiling by christie took place on january . 
in total the sculpture cost . 
CD to design and construct twice the original estimate , as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs . 
funding was sourced from a european regional development fund contribution of , , the north west development agency , contributing , , and manchester city council providing , . 
structural problems and legal action 
the tip of CD of the . 
m . 
ft spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on january , only CD days before the official unveiling . 
after inspection , the event went ahead as planned . 
CD months later , in may , a second spike had to be cut off by after it was discovered hanging loose . 
at that time the sculpture was closed off to the public , and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed . 
as a result , some of the joints were re , with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement . 
this consisted of tip weights to of the spikes weights . 
despite these modifications , b of the bang remained off , prompting a local newspaper campaign to get it . 
in may a total of CD spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for analysis , to discover the stresses being placed on the steel . 
it was announced in october that manchester city council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture , with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture . 
in november this culminated in an out of court settlement being reached between manchester city council , the project designers thomas studio ltd , and the engineering and construction lucas ltd , flint and partnership and structures ltd . 
the agreement was to pay the council in damages for breach of contract and negligence . 
acting on a report in january , the city council recommended that b of the bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe .

in january , antony , creator of the angel of the north to which b of the bang is often compared spoke out in support of the sculpture , stating that , it is a great tribute to manchester that this ground breaking work was commissioned . 
to allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council . 
despite plea , removal of b of the bang began in april . 
more substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm brothers limited began removing the spikes with cutting equipment . 
although the council had promised to store the complex central core and legs , these too were cut apart during removal , casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture return , and in early july the core was sold as scrap for , . 
fort scott national historic site 
fort scott national historic site is a historical area under the control of the united states national park service in bourbon county , kansas , united states . 
named after general winfield scott , who achieved during the mexican american war , during the middle of the century the fort served as a military base for us army action in what was the edge of settlement in . 
for the next quarter century , it was used as a supply base and to provide security in turbulent areas during the opening of the west to settlement , a period which included bleeding kansas and the american civil war . 
the current national historic site protects historic structures , a parade ground , and CD acres , m of restored prairie , inside the city of fort scott . 
it is open to visitors most days of the year . 
history 
in , fort scott was named after winfield scott , was established on the american frontier on the military road in eastern kansas between fort and fort gibson . 
it was established to provide protection to the rapidly increasing number of settlers , who were migrating from the eastern united states . 
fort scott became CD of a chain of forts intended to protect the new settlers from the plains indians , as well as to protect the indians from the settlers encroachment . 
the united states government intention to reserve permanent indian lands west of the missouri river gave way to the competition of settlers continuing to on the indian settlements . 
fort scott most active days were between and , although it was also used during the civil war . 
army days 
the of indian territory now oklahoma were upset to have fort wayne in their proximity . 
after some delay , the us army decided to abandon fort wayne and move its soldiers to a new fort to be built between fort and the site . 
the army both wanted to the who were supervised by the department of defense and provide more defense for white settlers and other indians against the osage , who had been conducting frequent raids in the area . 
on april , , some soldiers of fort wayne left their fort and on april arrived where fort scott would be built , in the osage section of modern day kansas . 
after with the to acquire the land , the rest of fort wayne garrison left the fort on may and arrived at the fort scott site on may . 
unlike most forts for military use , the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built the wide open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary . 
the soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men , animals , and equipment . 
these buildings were on the edges of a foot m parade ground . 
the post , captain thomas swords , was in charge of building fort scott structures , and had to deal with the problems of construction on the kansas prairie , which had few trees . 
he had only CD and CD carpenters to rely on , as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform . 
wood was available , but the mill was built . 
miles . 
km away , making transport time consuming . 
swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood , skilled labor and working equipment . 
freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort construction . 
as a result , only CD of the CD planned officers quarters CD and post commandant house was built by , and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed . 
in his inspection of the fort , colonel george reported that , in comparison to other frontier forts , he considered fort scott above average . 
due to the rising tensions that escalated in the mexican american war , the us army redeployed troops to the southwest . 
with fort scott still uncompleted , officials decided on april , , that no more construction would be done there , after CD years and , . 
by the time it was finished , it was obsolete CD years later , it was abandoned by the military in favor of the more western fort riley . 
for the average soldier , life at the fort was . 
until the permanent structures were built , soldiers had to live in tents , which lacked comfort . 
aside from a few whiskey and prostitutes , few civilians lived at the fort . 
officers had brought their personal slaves with them , including captain swords . 
CD miles east in missouri was a shop that supplied soldiers , and quite a few courts martial followed soldiers going at the shop . 
the rate from the fort ranged from , due to boredom , irregular pay , and hatred for military life . 
as no combat took place near the fort , it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base . 
hunting was a popular according to captain swords , wolf chasing and duck hunting was the only way CD officer could tolerate the place . 
bleeding kansas 
CD years after the army abandoned the fort , the buildings were sold by auction to civilians , with CD being converted to hotels . 
in the kansas nebraska act repealed the missouri of , which had kept slavery out of kansas . 
in favor of slavery soon moved to kansas to try to sway the vote of whether or not kansas would permit slavery . 
settlers from new england arrived equally determined to keep it out . 
each of the CD competing factions of the bleeding kansas conflict claimed CD of the hotels at fort scott free soil at the fort scott hotel and pro at the western hotel . 
most of the residents in fort scott supported slavery , but those outside the town tended to the free soil side . 
during this time , there were local incidents of murder and attempted , typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting . 
army returns 
during the american civil war , the fort was renewed as a us military post . 
in august , the union army took command of fort scott , and it for the war times . 
the united states army also took over several blocks within the town for and functions . 
the union army rented the properties from the current civilian owners . 
troops from indiana , iowa , colorado , ohio , and wisconsin would come to the fort , and either stayed by the fort , or traveled farther , to missouri , arkansas , or the indian territory . 
fort scott was CD of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the united states troops of the union army . 
a major supply depot was situated at the fort . 
confederate general sterling price hoped to capture the town , but the closest the confederate force came to the garrison was miles km away at battle of dry wood creek . 
the site was strategically important as it was within a southern area and close to the confederate state of arkansas and the unstable indian territory present day state of oklahoma , where many of the members of the CD were allied with the confederates . 
the fort served as a general hospital large military hospital and prison until after the war . 
following the end of the war , in october the us army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled . 
on january , , the army returned with the formation of the post of southeast kansas . 
the post was based at fort scott , but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks , and seldom used the original fort . 
they were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers . 
some of the latter feared that the railroad , which had been awarded land for development by the us government in rights of way , would evict them from their homes . 
the settlers considered the troops to the railroads , and both as enemies . 
settlers also had some continuing conflicts with indians and insurgents using the recent confederate cause as excuse for robbery . 
by the spring of , the us army withdrew the troops from fort scott for good . 
from to , the buildings of the fort were left , and slowly deteriorated . 
many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built for civilian use . 
modern times 
with the act of august , , the national park service gave the city government of fort scott , kansas the necessary funds and technical knowledge to restore the fort . 
on october , , fort scott became a national historic site under the supervision of the national park service , encompassing acres , m2 . 
today the fort is open throughout the year , save for , christmas , and new years day .

background and creation 
most music historians date the writing of the blues to lead june trip to washington , dc , when he was invited by the alan to record for the library of congress folk music collection . 
on the first night lead and his wife martha spent in the city , they encountered racially jim crow laws similar to those found in their native louisiana most hotels refused to rent rooms to african americans and the few that would were either full or refused to serve him because he was with a white man . 
, in some versions of the story described as an unnamed white friend , offered to let the couple stay for the night in his apartment near the supreme court building . 
the next morning , lead to arguing with his about the presence of a black man , with the threatening to call the police . 
while in washington , lead encountered several other incidents of segregation that are believed to have contributed to the of the song . 
for instance , when lead , , and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together , they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them . 
lead was told that if he returned later without , he would be served . 
in response to CD of these incidents , a friend of lead , variously identified as either or mary elizabeth joked that washington was a town . 
though lead did not know what the word meant , he was fascinated by the sound of it , and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip . 
the song came together quickly CD account claims that it only took a few hours for lead to write it . 
liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment . 
lyrics , themes and music 
the blues is a blues style protest song that criticizes the culture of washington , dc .

the first CD verses speak of the segregation that lead encountered in washington dc the first recounts the fact that during the trip , lead was turned down wherever he tried to get served due to his race , while the second recounts the argument between and his over lead staying in his apartment . 
the third verse cites the home of the brave , the land of the free , juxtaposed with the mistreatment he received at the hands of white people in washington , dc . 
the fourth verse speaks of the racism of the white population of the city , leading to the song end , which suggests that african americans boycott buying homes in the district . 
the song tone implies that the speaker feels powerless against the discrimination and racism that he encounters despite this , by spreading the news of his poor treatment in a song , the speaker uses what power he has to tell both southern african americans and northern whites that the status is deeply flawed and that something needs to change . 
the blues follows a traditional CD bar blues format .

finally , bragg the united states government for not dealing with poverty at home before going to war . 
legacy 
the blues is CD of lead most famous songs and is remembered as his most heartfelt protest song . 
there is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance . 
robert claims that the song is peripheral to the wider study of the blues , while lawson points to it as a watershed in the way african americans see themselves in the fabric of the united states . 
there is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics . 
after its release , it became popular with left wing political groups . 
lead was invited to perform at camp unity , the communist party usa summer retreat , and the fbi subsequently opened a file on him in the . 
this led to the accusations that the communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform . 
the party claims , to the contrary , that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform . 
jeff todd and several other writers have suggested that lead had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song . 
this theory stems from the idea that lead did not have a history of protest music before he was discovered by . 
since the music that recorded was sold to sympathetic to civil rights , it has been suggested that helped him write a song attractive to a white audience . 
lead admitted that the term was unfamiliar to him , and it seems out of place compared to the vocabulary of his past work .

development 
background and character design 
in , sega ordered its in house development studio , , to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company . 
this was a position already held by the character alex , but he was considered similar to mario and deemed unsatisfactory sega president wanted a character as iconic as mickey mouse . 
sega had competition from nintendo and its mascot , mario , in mind nintendo was dominant at the time , particularly after the release of the successful super mario bros. , and sega wanted a foothold in the industry . 
although the company had some success with genesis ports of its arcade titles , it knew this would not be enough . 
developed ideas for characters , an engine , and gameplay mechanics . 
development emphasized speed , so eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals , as well as fast creatures like and squirrels . 
CD idea , a able to grasp objects with prehensile ears , showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware . 
the team narrowed its search to animals that can roll into a ball , their idea for an attacking move . 
then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough , so they focused on CD animals with spikes and . 
the character , first proposed by , prevailed , although the would later become the basis for mighty the who first appeared in the hedgehog . 
has admitted since that he created sonic basic design by combining felix the cat head with mickey mouse body . 
sonic was originally colored , then a light shade of blue , but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the sega logo . 
his shoes were colored red through the inspiration of michael jackson boots on the album cover for bad and the outfit of santa claus , whom saw as the most famous character in the world . 
sonic spikes were emphasized to make him look , and he was given the ability to spin while jumping so attacking and jumping could be controlled with CD button . 
the new character was originally named mr. , but the CD member changed his name to sonic and their studios to sonic team . 
proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band , giving him vampire fangs , and giving him a human girlfriend named madonna , but sega of america scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple . 
sega of america also expressed concerns that most americans would not know what a is and initially proposed a full scale recreation of the character , but compromised with sonic team to simply make design changes . 
the antagonist ended up being named dr. in japan and dr. in other regions as a result of a dispute between sega american and japanese divisions . 
programming and 
with a satisfying protagonist completed , sega turned to esteemed programmer , who had impressed them through his work on star and the genesis port of n . 
the gameplay originated with a tech demo by , who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix . 
prototype was a platform game with a fast moving character rolling in a ball through a long , winding tube , and this concept was out with character designs and levels by designer . 
originally intended to work on the game for CD months due to the delay of his planned move to the united states by the outbreak of the gulf war , but was in the project for nearly a year . 
his designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design . 
the game color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist suzuki , and the aesthetics of green hill were influenced by the geography of california . 
in designing the game mechanics , was inspired by shigeru miyamoto , whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier . 
the simplicity of miyamoto mechanics in complex environments , decided that sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping . 
he also wanted his creation to be more action oriented than the mario series while playing super mario bros. , he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly . 
due to the need to demonstrate the genesis technological prowess , the developing game underwent extensive testing and redesign , a process taking over CD months . 
the developers efforts were rewarded according to , the game had the fastest ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that was considered impossible on the console . 
the team intended to add a CD player mode displayed via split screen , but programming knowledge was insufficient to implement this feature . 
however , such a mode would later appear in sequel sonic the hedgehog , where the second player would control sonic best friend miles . 
, , and worked hours a day on the project for several months . 
relationship with sega of japan was tenuous during this time he received little credit for his involvement in the game . 
he left the company shortly after the game release , although sega of america hired him later . 
before leaving , however , he defied sega of japan prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background , identifiable only by looking at the game code . 
music 
the music for sonic the hedgehog was composed and produced by masato , bassist and lead songwriter of the j pop band dreams come true . 
the game uses yamaha and programmable sound generators to produce a variety of sound effects and music . 
it was originally intended to have a sound test menu with animations of sonic to the music of a sonic band of on guitar , max monkey on bass , on drums , and the crocodile on keyboard . 
the playable became a recurring character in the series , also appearing in , sonic heroes , and sonic free . 
the development schedule scrapped the feature , and replaced the test with the se 
chant used in tv commercials which reportedly used CD eighth of the memory of the CD cartridge . 
on october , , CD years after the game release , a CD disc compilation of music from sonic the hedgehog and sonic the hedgehog was released in japan . 
the first disc features original tracks from both games , the second contains masato demo recordings and the third comprises songs by dreams come true and their remixes . 
and release 
game package illustrator akira said that his goal was to make the characters colorful , using clear lines and to finish them . 
according to , the developers asked him to create a package design similar to pop art : without being particular to conventional packages something original and stylish . 
the game was released in north america , europe , and australia on june , , and in japan on july . 
sega of america packaged it with american genesis consoles , replacing beast . 
genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of sonic the hedgehog by mail . 
sega of america created a large scale marketing campaign to promote the game and sonic as a mascot for the company .

it is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through . 
or christie hole in the south west is another spectacular cave , part of the roof of which collapsed in . 
yet another is hole close to in the west . 
this was the favourite of john tudor who wrote of the island in his victorian memoirs and described the cave as : in , so exquisite is the colouring of the roof and sides and so is the water . with or like in a church . 
in the spectacular headland , da horn o papa fell into the sea during a storm . 
the nearby of also has caves that can be accessed by small boats when conditions permit . 
ecology 
, grey seals , killer and harbour are frequently seen on and around papa . 
atlantic , arctic and common , and arctic , northern , common , , , , ringed and great black backed gull all breed on the island , and numerous migratory species have been recorded . 
there is a of wild flowers , including mountain , spring and as well as the ubiquitous . 
the west side of the island is a site of special scientific interest and the seas around papa are a special area of conservation . 
the traditional shetland pony is still bred . 
history and archaeology 
human settlement of the island dates from circa bc and there are remains of several neolithic burial chambers known as heel shaped . 
little is known of the pre celtic and celtic eras , but when the norse arrived it is likely they found a religious settlement as the name of the island derives from meaning big island of the celtic monks , in distinction to papa little some kilometres . 
mi to the west . 
norse period 
papa is the subject of a manuscript written in old norse , which is the oldest surviving document from shetland . 
it deals with a dramatic incident in the house of duke , who was later to become king CD of norway . 
there is a circle of stones near the beach at , which are the remains of a , or local assembly . 
this was the scene of a duel , fought and won by lord , who was accused of corruption in the document and was later called de . 
the story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above . 
the remains of duke thirteenth century house are still visible near . 
scots rule and fishing 
in shetland came under nominal scottish control , although the norse of norway kept their papa estates until the century . 
in the century merchants from and hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet . 
by the century , CD scottish , thomas of , and arthur of , owned the island . 
they maintained a prosperous old norse deep sea fishing industry , undertaken in the summer months using CD boats known as . 
in addition to the colony on there may have been another at overlooking . 
a recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed century colony . 
the island church , which kirk sand in the bay of fore , was founded in . 
metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of or on the headland between the west end of kirk sand and the bay of . 
it is called the by locals and referred to by the ordnance survey as the site of a chapel belonging to about the twelfth century . 
there is a tradition that the work there was with by supernatural powers and that each day work on the building was destroyed during the night . 
eventually the were moved overnight by these agencies to the present site of the church and work was re commenced there successfully . 
excavations in found little besides large blocks of and a piece of whalebone rib , suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it . 
in the century the fishing station in west was opened and the island had a population of people or more . 
however , fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam saw a fall in population from the on . 
at this time another duel entered the history of papa . 
edwin lindsay , an indian army officer and the son of the earl of , was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in CD . 
he spent years as a prisoner before the quaker preacher catherine watson arranged for his release in . 
lindsay well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe . 
there are good examples of horizontal water mills , also known as norse or mills , around dutch loch . 
originally these were CD story buildings with turf roofs , built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill stone was sited . 
inside the building there was a fixed lower , and a rotating upper driven by the water falling onto the below . 
some were still in use on papa in the early years of the century , and there is still a working example of CD of these mills on the burn of , at in the south of shetland . 
and centuries 
in common with many small scottish islands , papa population peaked in the century and has experienced a significant decline since then see e.g. 
. 
by the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen fairly elderly residents , but an advertisement in exchange and mart reversed the decline . 
a and CD sheep were offered free of charge to which brought a flood of applicants . 
by the census recorded a population of . 
however , by the population had fallen to after serious between led to several court cases . 
a number of people left the island and the school closed . 
by early the population had dropped to just CD after a family of CD left . 
the census recorded a usually resident population of during the decade scottish island populations as a whole grew by to , . 
overview of population trends 
the coasts around papa have claimed numerous wrecks . 
in , alone has sunk dutch , french , german and norwegian ships . 
the aberdeen trawler ben doran , on the miles northwest of papa , on the evening of march while on her way to the village of to land her catch . 
when she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw , and reported the wreck . 
by the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the and local volunteers there being no lifeboat in shetland at that time , weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the . 
a request had been made for the lifeboat from orkney , only miles away , to launch , but the request was made too late to be of help . 
all crew perished in the wreck . 
only bodies were recovered , that of james mitchell , which was returned to aberdeen , and the bodies of j. 
and , which were buried in . 
the cargo ship ss ran aground in fog on in february . 
on this occasion the conditions were and only the ship and cargo were lost . 
in the aberdeen trawler ran aground in sound at the bottom of the metres feet cliffs . 
the man crew were rescued by the lifeboat , the being awarded the silver medal for this rescue . 
papa most recent occurred on december when the aberdeen trawler elinor viking , alec , on the . 
the came to the scene but was unable to get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions . 
at the request of alec webster , station officer , , a volunteer crew in a british airways helicopter from airport was . 
they managed to all the boat crew to safety within hours of the , despite the storm force winds . 
the helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery . 
there was no loss of life , but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the in , and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present search and rescue helicopter unit , based at airport .

there is a post office at the pier , but no shop . 
electricity only came to the island at the close of the twentieth century . 
the papa project is a christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues . 
now sail across the sound of papa to west on the shetland . 
the crossing takes minutes , and although the carries cars , there is only CD short road on the visiting the CD main provide good shelter , but the strong tides in both the sound of papa and to the north west require considerable care . 
there is an airstrip which for regular flights from . 
culture and the arts 
the papa sword dance may be of norse origin and bears similarities to the long sword dance of the north east of england . 
a description of the dance appears in the pirate by sir walter scott . 
the writer and journalist john sands lived on papa and for a while during the late nineteenth century . 
the writer , and musician , george p. s. peterson was brought up on papa . 
it is also the papa of poem da sang o da papa men , now adopted as part of the tradition , as set to music by manson . 
the chorus chant , 
, is particularly striking . 
da horn o papa , 
a hidden piece o water . 
da boat da tide , da is we fish is , 
refers to the practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of were no longer visible . 
this entailed the boat being some kilometres mi west of papa . 
the tide are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide . 
the final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to papa by the scent o across the water . 
this is an example of ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation . 
an extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that da horn o papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem composition , so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life , but a noted geographical feature . 
first invasion of burma 
the first invasions of burma were a series of military conflicts between khan yuan dynasty , division of the empire , and the pagan empire that took place between and . 
the invasions toppled the year old pagan empire , and the army seized pagan territories in present day , and northern burma to . 
the invasions in years of political fragmentation in burma and the rise of tai shan states throughout mainland southeast asia . 
the mongols first demanded tribute from pagan in , as part of their drive to encircle the song dynasty of china . 
when king refused , emperor khan himself sent another mission in , again demanding tribute . 
it too was rejected . 
in , the emperor ordered the government to secure the in order to block an escape path for the song , and permitted a limited border war if pagan contested . 
pagan did contest but its army was driven back at the frontier by the army in . 
after a brief lull , khan in turned his attention to southeast asia , demanding tribute from pagan , the khmer empire , and . 
when the king again refused , the emperor ordered an invasion of northern burma . 
CD dry season campaigns later , the mongols had occupied down to and , forcing the king to flee to lower burma . 
the mongols organized northern burma as the province of . 
negotiations began in , and ended with finally agreeing to submit in june . 
the embassy , received by the emperor in beijing in january , agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the of the yuan dynasty or the empire over the pagan empire and annual payments in taxes to the government in exchange for the evacuation of troops from northern burma . 
but the treaty never really took effect as was assassinated in july , and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged . 
the command at now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void , and ordered an invasion of central burma . 
they may not have reached pagan , and even if they did , after having suffered heavy casualties , they returned to . 
the pagan empire and anarchy ensued . 
the mongols , who probably preferred the situation , did nothing to restore order in the next CD years . 
in march , they accepted the voluntary submission of king of pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of pagan . 
but was overthrown CD months later , and the mongols were forced to intervene , leading to their second invasion in . 
marco polo reported the first invasions in his , il . 
the referred to the invaders as the after the central asian troops that largely made up the invasion army today , the term refers to the han chinese instead . 
king is remembered in history as , the king who from the . 
background 
pagan and 
in the century , the pagan empire , along with the khmer empire , was CD of the CD main empires in mainland southeast asia . 
for much of its history , pagan neighbor to the northeast was not china but the independent kingdom and its predecessor , both with as their capital city . 
based kingdoms were a power in their own right , at times themselves with the empire to their west and at other times with china tang and song dynasties . 
indeed , mounted armies ventured deep into what is today burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of pagan and the pagan dynasty itself . 
between the newly conquered territory and pagan were a wide of stretching from present day , and prefectures in as well as the and regions presumably in present day northern shan state , which pagan and had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence . 
then as now , the mostly consist of of high mountain ranges . 
conquest of 
the empire first arrived at the of the pagan empire in by invading the kingdom in its attempt to outflank song china . 
the armies captured the capital , , on january , and went on to much of the kingdom by . 
the arrival of the mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the as the mongols were intent on finishing off the song . 
for the next dozen years , they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land , which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from china to burma and india . 
the mongols set up military garrisons , manned mostly by speaking muslims from central asia , in circuits of the former kingdom . 
decline of pagan 
by then , the pagan empire , despite outward appearances of calm , had been in long and slow decline since the early century . 
the continuous growth of tax free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom . 
the crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen , inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges . 
although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in in south and , the decline continued . 
on the eve of the invasions , between CD and CD thirds of upper burma land had been donated to religion . 
the crown ability to defenses was in serious jeopardy . 
prelude to war 
first mission 
the period of calm for pagan ended in the early . 
by then , the song were on the ropes , and emperor khan , who officially founded the yuan dynasty on december , sought to cut off the retreat of song refugees in all directions . 
in pagan case , he had ordered the governor of to control of the , and in january to send a mission to pagan to demand tribute . 
the tribute he demanded was nominal . 
given his higher priority elsewhere , the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at pagan . 
at the border , the ruler of the and regions submitted to the mongols . 
when the envoys led by showed up , the pagan court led by chief minister was well aware of the military power of the mongols and advised king to use diplomacy . 
the king was furious at the demand and kept the envoys waiting for weeks . 
the court finally devised a compromise the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king . 
them was a envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the king wish to CD day worship a buddha tooth at beijing . 
the king then promptly ordered an expedition , which retook the rebellious regions in april . 
the rebel leader a was brought back to pagan . 
relayed the news to beijing but did not carry out any military action . 
second mission 
at beijing , khan , who was preparing an invasion of japan , decided against a war with pagan for the time being . 
on march , he sent a member delegation led by an imperial ambassador , the first secretary to the board , to pagan . 
the delegation carried a letter from the emperor . 
the letter says if you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the all highest , send CD of your brothers or senior ministers , to show men that all the world is linked with us , and enter into a perpetual alliance . 
this will add to your reputation , and be in your own interests for if it comes to war , who will be the victor 
well , o king , our words . 
this time , the king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit . 
the chronicles say that the king was so insulted that he had the envoys executed . 
but both evidence and yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed . 
at any rate , the imperial envoys did not get back to in due time . 
the newly formed government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation , but the delegation could not reach pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route . 
consolidation of 
meanwhile , in , the former kingdom was officially reorganized as the province of , with al din omar as governor . 
in may , the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned that the evidently had no intention of submitting and that war was the only way forward . 
but the emperor rejected an outright invasion . 
just coming off a disastrous japanese campaign , the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair . 
he was now focused on delivering the final blow against the song the emperor ordered the provincial army to secure the in order to block the escape path of the song refugees . 
he also sanctioned a limited border war if pagan contested the takeover . 
as planned , the army proceeded to consolidate the in . 
elsewhere , the main armies had captured most of the song territory by . 
by , at least CD vassal state named gold modern had submitted to the mongols . 
like in , the government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state but unlike in , the mongols had posted a sizable garrison there . 
though it was ultimately under command , many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were speaking peoples or people from the further west turks from , , and , but also captive soldiers from the persian empire , the , and even from the lower . 
border war 
what followed was a border war in . 
it was reported mainly in the yuan dynasty chronicle and the of marco polo . 
although the chronicles have no record of the border war , a inscription mentions the army defeat at . 
the accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate . 
battle of 
according to the yuan dynasty chronicle and marco polo accounts , a army invaded the territory of gold , and was defeated by the army in april . 
the battle took place either at the valley in present day prefecture or km southwest at present day , prefecture , which the called . 
the yuan chronicle reports that only men defeated a army of , to , with , horses and . 
it also reports only CD was killed , in trying to catch an elephant . 
according to marco polo , the army consisted of , mounted , and the army numbered , men with , on each of which was set a tower of timber , well framed and strong , and carrying from to well armed fighting men . 
even then , the , to , figures of the army strength were likely eye estimates and may still be too high the mongols may have on the side of generosity not to their glory in defeating superior numbers . 
according to marco polo account , in the early stages of the battle , the turkish and horsemen took such at the sight of the that they would not be got to face the , but always and turned back , while the forces pressed on . 
but the commander did not panic he ordered his troops to , and from the cover of the nearby , aim their bows directly at the advancing . 
the arrows threw the animals into such pain that they fled . 
raid of 
the army pressed on after the monsoon season . 
in the following dry season of , c . 
december , a army of led by al din , son of , advanced to , which defended the pass . 
they occupied the fort and destroyed a large number of abandoned . 
but they found the heat excessive and returned . 
interlude 
despite the military success , the control of the remained contested . 
pagan did not relinquish its claim to the frontier regions , and the , apparently taking advantage of elsewhere , rebuilt their forts at and later in , posting permanent garrisons commanded by . 
but their control was short lived . 
the great khan attention turned to southeast asia once more in . 
he had had mixed success his forces had finished off the last of the song in but had again failed to take japan in . 
that year , the emperor sent another mission to pagan , demanding tribute yet again . 
the king was to send his CD senior ministers accompanied by CD CD cavalry officers to the emperor court . 
with , the emperor summoned the king of himself to beijing . 
at pagan , with his court for an appropriate response but ultimately refused to submit . 
the court may have been counting on another limited border war but the emperor now ordered an invasion of northern burma . 
he also ordered an invasion of , whose king too had refused to submit . 
the king troubles did not go elsewhere in the kingdom . 
in the same year , a named seized the southern port city of by killing its pagan appointed governor . 
although the king CD sons were of the nearby lower burma cities in , , and , the king , preoccupied with much more serious threat in the north , did not or could not take any action on . 
throughout , the command made preparations for the upcoming invasions of and northern burma . 
the objective of the burma campaign was to take over northern burma but no further the emperor did not an attack on pagan itself . 
at least CD army consisted of , men of the persian empire under the command of was sent to to reinforce the burma invasion force , which again was made up of turks and other central . 
on the side , the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals , he probably could not have raised a large one . 
by mid , a army led by generals and was deployed at a fort at . 
invasion 
battle of 
the invasion began on september . 
prince was the commander in chief of the invasion force his deputies were vice governor , and commander . 
the armies marched to the border in CD columns . 
CD column advanced along the river using over boats the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the fort at . 
the chronicles report an overwhelming number of forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated . 
the chronicles say that the army numbered , men while the army numbered CD men and CD horses . 
the withstood the siege for over CD months but the fort fell on december . 
invasion of northern burma 
the defeat at broke the back of defenses . 
the army lost several CD men as well as senior commanders . 
, the next fort , fell just CD days later on december . 
the sources say that the lost , men at . 
the armies pushed farther south into the valley . 
they took the ancient capital of , about km north of pagan on february . 
there , the invaders paused their advance . 
they found the heat of the searing valley excessive , and evacuated , allowing the to return to on may . 
but the army renewed their offensive in the following dry season . 
they retook , and defeated another stand south of , probably near , on january , opening the way to pagan , about km south . 
after the defeat , the king , and fled to lower burma . 
the evacuation proved premature . 
the forces did not advance on pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan . 
the country fell into chaos . 
in lower burma , the king found himself isolated , let alone plan a counterattack . 
although his sons ruled the key lower burma ports , and , the king did not trust any of them , and he and his court settled at , west of . 
without the full support of his sons , the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one . 
the governor of that same year . 
the king managed to send CD small expeditions to but they both failed . 
now , the entire eastern half of lower burma and was in open revolt . 
peace negotiations 
given his precarious position , decided to buy time , and sue for peace with the mongols . 
in november december , the king ordered his generals and bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations . 
the commanders at , who had organized northern burma as a protectorate named chinese wade giles , agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission . 
they repeated their demand that the king send a formal delegation to the emperor . 
the CD sides had reached a tentative agreement by march , which calls for a full submission of the pagan empire , and central burma to be organized as the province of chinese wade giles chung . 
after a long , the king agreed to submit but wanted the troops to withdraw . 
in june , he sent an embassy led by shin , a learned monk , to the emperor court . 
treaty of beijing 
in january , the embassy arrived at beijing , and was received by the yuan emperor . 
the delegation formally acknowledged of their kingdom , and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country . 
indeed , the tribute was no longer nominal . 
in exchange , the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops . 
for the emperor , the burma campaign was the only bright spot his other southeast asian expeditions had gone badly . 
he did not want to invest more troops the rest of the kingdom . 
he preferred a vassal ruler . 
the embassy arrived back at in may , and reported the terms to the king . 
but the agreement broke down a month later . 
in late june , the defeated king and his small retinue left their temporary capital for pagan . 
but on july , the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son , the viceroy of . 
anarchy ensued . 
each region in the country which had not broke away . 
no successor to , who could honor and enforce the terms of the treaty of beijing , emerged . 
indeed , a king would not emerge until may . 
intervention 
given the chaos , the governor of ignored the imperial orders of evacuation . 
the army commanded by prince sin , a grandson of the emperor , marched south toward pagan . 
according to mainstream traditional british colonial era scholarship , the army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate fought its way down to pagan with the loss of men occupied the city and sent out to receive homage , CD of which reached south of . 
but not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of pagan or the temporary of the conquest . 
recent research shows that the forces most probably never reached pagan . 
they were held at bay by the defenses led by commanders , and , and probably never got closer than km north of pagan . 
an inscription dated february by the CD brothers claimed that they defeated the army . 
even if the mongols did reach pagan , the damage they inflicted was probably minimal . 
at any rate , the army suffered heavy casualties , and retreated north to . 
they remained there as the treaty was now void . 
aftermath 
the disintegration of the pagan empire was now complete . 
but the mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created . 
they would send no more expeditions to restore order . 
the emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that would be required to the fragmented country . 
indeed , his real aim all along may have been to keep the entire region of southeast asia broken and fragmented . 
it would be another CD years until CD of sons , , emerged as king of pagan in may . 
but the new king controlled just a small area around the capital , and had no real army . 
the real power in central burma now rested with the CD commander brothers . 
the uneasy arrangement would persist until . 
the mongols continued to occupy northern burma to as the province of but ended the fictional central burma province of on august . 
meanwhile , the power struggle in central burma continued with the CD brothers consolidating support . 
to check their rising power , submitted to the mongols in january , and was recognized by the yuan emperor khan as king of pagan on march . 
the emperor also gave chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of . 
the brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power . 
on december , the CD brothers , and founded the kingdom . 
the forced the government to intervene again , leading to the second invasion of burma . 
the invasion failed . 
CD years later , on april , the mongols abolished the province of , evacuated , and returned to . 
legacy 
the war was CD of several near simultaneous wars by the empire and the yuan dynasty in the late century . 
though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the mongols , the war set off a series of enduring developments in burma . 
the invasions in a period of political fragmentation , and the rise of tai shan states throughout mainland southeast asia . 
age of political fragmentation 
the immediate result of the war was the collapse of the pagan empire . 
however , the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it . 
pagan disintegration was in fact more prolonged and . 
the kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early century . 
had pagan possessed a stronger central government , the collapse could have been temporary , and the country could have risen again . 
but the dynasty could not recover , and because the mongols refused to fill the power vacuum , no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath . 
as a result , several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the century . 
it was only in the late century that CD relatively strong powers emerged in the basin , restoring some semblance of normalcy . 
the vast region surrounding the valley would continue to be made up of several small tai shan states well into the century . 
rise of tai shan states 
perhaps the most enduring legacy of the invasions was the emergence of tai shan states in mainland southeast asia . 
the tai shan people who came down with the invasions stayed . 
by the early century , several tai shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present day to northern and eastern to northern and central thailand and laos . 
their rise was encouraged by the mongols , who viewed the states as a useful between and the rest of southeast asia . 
the mongols , who were still trying to incorporate into the central administration , were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of into the fold . 
the integration of itself into china was to take several more centuries , and continues to today . 
as such , from the newly formed tai shan states in western and central southeast asia to dai viet and in eastern southeast asia , the mongols elected to receive nominal tribute . 
though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the yuan government , they were the native chieftains , who would have ruled there in any case , and they did as they pleased . 
of china on the border 
the war also marked the arrival of china at the of burma . 
the old kingdom , known to the as , after raj was now a chinese province . 
the now called the new powers at after the speaking soldiers of . 
over the years , the term came to be used to refer to the han chinese . 
today , king is remembered as , the king who fled from the chinese . 
from a standpoint , the chinese presence in pushed the shan migrations in the direction of burma and parts of the khmer empire . 
the raids by various shan states into upper burma would continue until the mid century . 
mongolia relations 
during the official visit by the president to in november , san suu , the of national league for democracy , said this was the first ever mission since the mongols came years earlier .

as a result , he was promoted to the ministry of personnel and gained to the academy , but before he could take up this appointment , beijing had fallen to the rebellion . 
since contemporaneous biographies work was not published until make no mention of these events , it has been suggested that they were fabricated after hu death . 
hu retired from public life and went into seclusion in , after the end of the ming dynasty . 
and recorded visiting him during his later years , in and respectively . 
he died in poverty at the age of , sometime around late or early . 
seal carving 
hu was a noted seal , producing personal seals for numerous dignitaries . 
his style was rooted in the classical seal script of the han dynasty , and he followed the school of carving founded by his contemporary he . 
hu calligraphy , although balanced and with a clear structure , is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed . 
seals attempt to an ancient , weathered impression , although unlike other artists hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals . 
hu work was known outside his local area . 
zhou , a poet who lived in around the same time as hu and was a noted art , stated in his biography of seal , that hu creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure , implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through . 
in , hu took it upon himself to create a new imperial seal for the emperor , which he carved after a period of and prayer . 
he presented his creation with an essay , the great of the seal , , in which he the loss of the emperor seal and heaven favour in restoring it . 
hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming , equally footed couplets , used in the imperial examinations , but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the southern ming court . 
CD studio 
despite his reputation as an artist and seal , hu was primarily a publisher . 
his publishing house , the CD studio , produced reference works on calligraphy , poetry and art medical textbooks books on etymology and and copies of as well as commentaries on the confucian classics . 
unlike other publishers in the area , the CD studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels . 
this bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio location the mountain on which hu took up residence was just to the north of the national academy , which provided a captive market for academic texts . 
between and , the CD studio produced over CD printed books of this kind , aimed at a wealthy , literary audience . 
the studio earliest publications were medical textbooks , the first of which , for , was published in and proved popular enough to be reissued CD years later . 
hu brother was a medical and appears to have been the author of these books . 
during the the CD studio also produced political works the rule of the ming these included the imperial ming record of huang ming ji , , a biography of loyal ming officials , and the of the imperial ming huang ming , , a list of imperial . 
after the fall of the ming dynasty , hu renamed the studio the hall in the past , as a sign of his affiliation with the previous dynasty , although the CD imprint continued to be used . 
despite hu withdrawal from society after , the studio continued to publish well into the qing dynasty , for the most part on seal impression catalogues showcasing hu carving work . 
the ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in china . 
at his studio , hu experimented with various forms of printing , creating processes for producing multi coloured prints and printed designs . 
as a result , he was able to produce some of china first printed publications in colour , using a block printing technique known as block printing , . 
this system made use of multiple blocks , each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour . 
it was a lengthy , process , requiring CD to CD engraved printing blocks and up to CD and impressions to create a single image . 
hu also employed a related form of multiple block printing called set block printing , , which had existed since the yuan period some years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again . 
he refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for some of the ink off the blocks before printing this enabled him to achieve and of shades which were not previously possible . 
in some images , hu employed a blind technique known as designs , or blocks , , using an , block to stamp designs onto paper . 
he used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants . 
this was a relatively new process , having been invented by hu contemporary wu , who was also a based publisher . 
wu had used this technique for the first time in his book wisteria studio paper , , published in . 
both hu and wu used to create decorative writing papers , the sale of which provided a income for the CD studio . 
major works 
hu most notable work is the CD studio manual of painting and , , an anthology of around prints by around CD different artists including hu himself , published in . 
it consists of CD sections , covering calligraphy , bamboo , flowers , rocks , birds and animals , plums , orchids and fruit . 
some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes . 
as well as a collection of artworks , it was also intended as an artistic , with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for to copy . 
although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo , the book still remains the first example of a and analytical approach to chinese painting . 
in this book , hu used his multiple block printing methods to obtain of colour in the images , rather than obvious outlines or overlaps . 
the manual is bound in the butterfly binding , style , whereby whole illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double page spread . 
this binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image . 
cambridge university library released a complete digital scan of the manual , including all writings and illustrations in august , . 
said charles , head of the cambridge university chinese department , the binding is so fragile , and the manual so delicate , that until it was , we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it despite its importance to scholars . 
this volume went on to influence colour printing across china , where it paved the way for the later but better known manual of the garden , and also in japan , where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in e of the colour printing process known as e . 
the popularity of the CD studio manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late qing dynasty . 
hu also produced the work CD studio paper , , a collection of paper samples , which made use of the stamped technique to make the illustrations stand out in relief . 
whilst primarily a catalogue of decorative writing papers , it also contained paintings of rocks , people , ritual vessels and other subjects . 
the book was bound in the wrapped back , style , in which the pages are folded , stacked , and along the open edges . 
originally published in , it was reissued in CD volumes between and by and lu , and revised and republished again in . 
other publications 
other works produced by hu studio included a reprint of zhou manual of seal script calligraphy , the CD of , and , and the related investigations into bi ji , , which discussed common errors in the formation of characters . 
with his brother , hu edited a new introductory edition of the confucian classics , entitled the text of the four books , and , , giving the correct formation and pronunciation of the text . 
a similar approach was taken with the of the thousand character classic in CD , , which hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy teacher , li . 
it was published after li death , partly in homage to him . 
the CD hu brothers worked together to a student on poetry by their contemporary , which was called simply the of poetry shi tan , . 
other works on poetry from the studio included to the of selected tang poems tang shi , , which was a compilation of several works on poetry and included by hu himself . 
among the studio more obscure publications was a text on chinese entitled , written under a pseudonym but with a preface by hu .

u.s. route in michigan 
us highway us is a component of the united states highway system that connects everett , washington , to the upper peninsula up of the us state of michigan , with a separate segment that runs from point , new york , to , maine . 
in michigan , the highway runs through the up in CD segments as a part of the state trunkline highway system , entering the state at and ending at st. ignace in between , us briefly traverses the state of wisconsin . 
as CD of the major transportation in the up , us is a major conduit for traffic through the state and neighboring northern midwest states . 
CD sections of the roadway are included as part of the great lakes circle , and other segments are listed as state designated pure michigan . 
there are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along us that date to the and . 
the highway runs through rural sections of the up , passing through CD national and CD state forests in the process . 
the route of what became us was used as part of CD indian trails before european settlers came to the up , and as part of the michigan segments of the theodore roosevelt international highway and the king international highway auto trails in the early century . 
the state later included these trails as part of m when the first state highway were designated in . 
most of m was redesignated as part of us when the us highway system was created on november , . 
since the , several changes have the highway routing through the up . 
CD such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with hurley , wisconsin , and others pushed an originally inland routing of us closer to the lake michigan shoreline . 
with the creation of the interstate highway system , part of us was rerouted to coincide with the new interstate i , though in the , the u.s. highway was truncated and removed from the i freeway , resulting in today basic form . 
route description 
according to a regional planning committee report , us is a key highway for michigan , providing its main western gateway . 
the roadway plays an important role in the transportation of goods across the northern tier of states in the midwest , and is listed on the national highway system nhs for its entire length . 
the nhs is a network of roadways important to the country economy , defense , and mobility . 
together with m , us is part of a pair of primary that bridge the eastern and western sides of the up . 
the .

km of roadway in michigan is divided into a . 
mile . 
km western segment and a . 
mile . 
km eastern segment , interrupted by a section that runs for . 
miles . 
km in the state of wisconsin . 
western segment 
us enters michigan from wisconsin for the first time north of downtown hurley , wisconsin , and , michigan , over the state line that runs along the montreal river . 
the highway crosses the river into county and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown . 
running along drive , us meets its only business route in michigan at douglas boulevard . 
the business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown and crossed the border into hurley and back to the main highway . 
the wisconsin department of transportation has removed the signage on their side of the border , which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line . 
us continues eastward through up woodlands to the city of . 
while bypassing the community of ramsay , the highway crosses a branch of the black river . 
the roadway enters wakefield on the south side of sunday lake , meeting m at a in town . 
as the us highway leaves wakefield , it turns southeasterly through the ottawa national forest , crossing jackson creek and CD branches of the isle river . 
us and m merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the isle in the community of . 
this concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state in the michigan department of transportation mdot recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of vehicles , compared to the overall average of , vehicles for the highway . 
at the end of the concurrency , m turns northerly to run along lake . 
the highway continues parallel to the state line from the area through the national forest toward . 
that unincorporated community is the home of the high school , the basketball team featured on a series of espn commercials and a documentary series on the sundance channel . 
the area is also where the waters meet the rolling hills drain to lake superior via the river , to lake michigan via the and rivers , or to the gulf of mexico via the wisconsin and mississippi rivers . 
also located in the area are the wilderness , and the lac desert indian , which includes the lac desert casino and resort . 
the highway travels southeasterly from around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural iron county . 
us intersects federal forest highway near golden lake in township in the middle of the national forest . 
the trunkline then runs along the iron river as it approaches the city of the same name and meets m . 
in town , us intersects m before crossing the river and turning northeast out of the city . 
us leaves the ottawa national forest at iron river , and the highway continues eastward through forest lands near several small lakes to crystal falls , the county seat of iron county . 
on the west side of town , us meets us the CD highways run concurrently along crystal avenue . 
the combined highway turns south onto street and meets m eastern terminus at the intersection between street and superior avenue next to the county at the top of the hill . 
us us runs south out of crystal falls to the west of , and parallel to , the river . 
the roadway passes railroad , kennedy and lakes and leaves the state of michigan at the river , crossing into florence county , wisconsin for about miles km . 
eastern segment 
us us re enters michigan where it crosses the river and subsequently meets m in township north of iron mountain and . 
the highways merge in a triple concurrency and run south on avenue into iron mountain along the west side of lake antoine , parallel to a branch line of the and lake superior railroad railroad . 
the road crosses through a retail corridor and over a flooded pit of the mine . 
in downtown iron mountain at street , m turns west off avenue to run across town to . 
us us exits downtown and turns east along a second retail corridor near the mall . 
the highway re enters township where us separates to the south to re enter wisconsin . 
us continues eastward parallel to a branch of the canadian national railway railway . 
both road and rail travel through the community of , where they pass near the largest paper mill in the up . 
the trunkline runs along the main street of norway , where the highway meets the eastern terminus of us . 
then us continues east through rural dickinson county to vulcan , passing north of lake through the country state forest , before crossing the sturgeon river in and passing into county . 
in county , the environment takes on a more agricultural character along us . 
the highway passes through the edge of the community of before entering powers . 
us comes to a CD way intersection and turns northeast merging onto us . 
the concurrent highway runs from powers through the communities of wilson and on the south side of the railway . 
at harris , the trunkline enters the indian community . 
harris is on the county side of the reservation , but as the highway continues east , it crosses over to river on the delta county side . 
the county line in between not only separates the CD communities , but also serves as the boundary between the central and eastern time zones . 
east of river , the highway crosses the community namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of m . 
the roadway crosses the ford river prior to turning due east into the outskirts of . 
us us to CD lanes along street , which forms the east west axis of the street grid . 
near downtown , the highway meets m , which runs along the city north south axis , lincoln avenue . 
the merge and run north , bypassing the traditional central business district for a different business corridor . 
lincoln avenue runs north carrying CD lanes of traffic past the upper peninsula state , site of CD of the CD state for the state of michigan , the only state to have twin . 
us us m continues north on lincoln avenue past the campus of bay de community college . 
the CD lane highway crosses the river just upstream from its mouth near the large mead paper mill and shifts to run immediately next to little bay de . 
the section here carried the highest traffic counts along all of us in the state an average of , vehicles used this segment of roadway daily in . 
the road turns inland again , and us us m passes to the west of downtown gladstone . 
the highway through here is an expressway , CD lanes divided by a central median and no access . 
unlike a freeway , the expressway has standard intersections and not interchanges . 
the highway intersects the eastern terminus of county road cr and crosses the railroad south of the for avenue north , where m separates from the us highways and turns to the northwest . 
the expressway continues north parallel to the railway , crossing the days river . 
through this area , the trunkline carries a speed limit of mph km h for car traffic . 
this is the only road in the up with a speed limit higher than mph km h besides i , which has a speed limit of mph km h . 
the expressway segment runs around the upper end of little bay de before ending at rapid river . 
in this location , us separates to the north , and us returns to an easterly track as a CD lane road , crossing the rapid and rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay . 
as us crosses southern delta county , it passes through the western unit of the national forest . 
near garden corners , the highway runs along the shore of big bay de . 
after the intersection with the northern terminus of m , us turns inland cutting across the base of the garden peninsula and enters schoolcraft county . 
as the highway approaches thompson , us leaves the western unit of the national forest and enters the lake superior state forest . 
the roadway runs along lake michigan to , crossing the river . 
the trunkline turns inland approaching and then turns north northeast to blaney park . 
the community there is a former logging town turned resort at the southern terminus of m the resort was active from the late but declined by the . 
from blaney park , us turns due east and crosses into mackinac county west of gould city . 
where it intersects a former routing , the main highway crosses the railway CD last time and runs to the south of to follow the lake michigan shoreline through . 
after passing the community of , us crosses the cut river bridge , feet CD over the cut river . 
the highway crosses into the eastern unit of the national forest near , running between lake michigan and lake in the process . 
the road continues along the lake michigan shoreline , passing spot near cap and turning inland immediately west of st. ignace . 
the us designation ends at the highway partial cloverleaf interchange with i . 
the roadway continues easterly into downtown st. ignace as business loop i bl i . 
history 
indian trail through auto trails 
in , the first transportation routes through what became the state of michigan were the lakes , rivers and indian trails . 
CD of these trails followed parts of the future us . 
the green bay trail roughly followed the lake michigan shoreline routing of us between and st. ignace . 
the mackinac trail connected st. ignace with . 
marie . 
in the age of the auto trail , the roads that later formed us through the up were given a few different highway names . 
when the original roadways between and iron river were completed in late , the upper peninsula development bureau named the area and the highway the trail . 
later the name was extended over the highway to , and to all highways in the area in the early the name was phased out by the completely in . 
the roadways were also used for the theodore roosevelt international highway , named for former us president theodore roosevelt after his death in . 
overall , this highway ran from portland , oregon , to portland , maine , by way of michigan and the canadian province of ontario . 
through the up , the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to us , including the section through florence county , wisconsin . 
the great lakes automobile route was established in by the . 
a predecessor of the great lakes circle by CD years , the route followed a circular journey along the banks of lakes michigan and superior and green bay : this route followed the modern us from to the m junction in , using the modern m and m to stay in michigan . 
of the route followed us and m between powers and . 
the route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around lake michigan . 
the name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of world war i. 
CD canadian auto trail was routed through the up as well . 
in , the king international highway linked vancouver , british columbia , to halifax , nova scotia , but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of lake superior . 
had to ship their cars by boat between . 
marie , ontario , and thunder bay or enter the united states to continue along the auto trail . 
the varied on the maps of the time , but its basic route used us through the up from to . 
marie until a highway north of lake superior was opened in by that time , the auto trail had taken on the trans canada highway name . 
state trunkline 
the first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern us was m , a designation that was in use by july , , between and . 
marie . 
the first roadside park in the country was created by herbert near what is now us near iron river in , although other sources state that the first was a picnic table alongside us grand river avenue in south of . 
when the us highway system was created on november , , us partially replaced m . 
between crystal falls and iron mountain , us was routed through florence , wisconsin . 
the former routing of m from crystal falls to became a new m when the former m became us now us . 
m from south to iron mountain was made a part of an extended m , which is now m . 
by the next year , m was added along us from to as part of a larger extension . 
the first changes to the routing of us itself were made in with a bypass of downtown . 
a larger was completed in between rogers park and . 
marie . 
the new routing followed mackinac trail instead of turning east to and north to . 
marie the former routing was given the m designation . 
another realignment in the iron mountain area shifted us us to a new bridge over the river between and . 
downtown was bypassed in , and the former route was initially designated m . 
the michigan state highway department mshd changed the and designations of the highways around , thompson and in the mid . 
the agency rerouted us between and m in thompson , turning the old road back to county control . 
the section between m and m was redesignated as an extension of m to thompson , and m was replaced by a further extension of m . 
the last change was to route us along its current alignment in the area , completing the changes on august , . 
the mshd started construction in on a new road that rerouted us into st. ignace for the first time . 
between and , us previously followed worth road inland to the trail to meet the northern extension of us into the upper peninsula . 
the new routing took us along the into st. ignace . 
us was truncated to the state ferry docks in mackinaw city and us was routed through st. ignace along the former us to rogers park the connection in st. ignace to the state ferry docks became m . 
further changes in the early the roadway out near and crystal falls . 
additional were completed by the mshd to move us to its modern routing between gould city and in . 
the new highway traveled due east from gould city to and then along the lake to . 
the former route through was turned back to local control as far east as . 
from there east , it was numbered just m , removing us from a concurrency . 
another former section into was added to extend m . 
the new highway was around the cut river bridge until it was completed in after construction delays over steel shortages during world war ii . 
the western end of us took on CD changes in the . 
m was extended along us to the state line at from its western terminus at wakefield . 
a similar extension was made from m eastern terminus to . 
marie in . 
the m designation was renumbered as business us by . 
the eastern m extension was reversed in , and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by . 
interstate era 
with the coming of the interstate highway system in michigan , the mshd planned to convert the eastern section of us to a freeway between st. ignace and st. marie . 
in planning maps from , this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the . 
it was also included in the general location of national system of interstate highways including all additional routes at urban areas in september , or yellow book after the cover color , that was released in as the federal government plans for the freeway system . 
the proposed number in was interstate i . 
the first section of freeway was built in late or early between and m north of st. ignace . 
the mackinac bridge was opened to traffic on november , a new section of freeway and an interchange connected us to the bridge . 
in , another new freeway segment closed the gap between the mackinac bridge and sections . 
at the time , the i designation us on the bridge , and us was shifted to follow i along the freeways in the st. ignace area . 
the former routing of us in downtown st. ignace was redesignated bl i . 
more sections of freeway were opened in immediately to the south of the newly constructed international bridge in . 
marie as well as between and . 
the last CD sections opened in connected the northern end of the freeway at m to , and the section between and . 
marie . 
at this time , all of us former routing became a county road known as mackinac trail h . 
the department of state highways expanded us us into an expressway between gladstone and rapid river in . 
the state built a new bridge over the river in , bypassing downtown . 
mdot disposed of the former routing of us into downtown in CD ways . 
the western half was initially an unnumbered state highway until it was later transferred to local control . 
an extension of m replaced the remainder , including the bridge , through downtown . 
in that same year , the department truncated us to end in st. ignace by removing it from the i freeway . 
the last changes were made to us routing through iron river in , bypassing the bridge that formerly carried the highway over the river in town . 
in , mdot raised the speed limit along the expressway section in delta county from to mph to km h , although the speed limit for trucks remains mph km h . 
memorial designations and tourist routes 
on july , , the state administrative board named m , the predecessor to us in michigan , the highway to honor frank p. , a prominent local citizen who later served in congress from to . 
in , the residents of created a memorial to the veterans of world war i called memory lane . 
the project consisted of and maple trees planted along us us west of town . 
the american legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers . 
later in , the women club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans . 
also called memory lane , the group planted and , , trees and shrubs as a parkway along . 
miles . 
km of us east of . 
most of us , along with us in the lower peninsula , was designated the united spanish war veterans memorial highway in . 
to connect the gap in the routing where us cuts through wisconsin , m and m were used in place of us between iron mountain and crystal falls . 
signs marking the highway were not erected until when governor george w. romney had them installed . 
the memorial drive designation was created for the section of us us m between the northern city limits and county road cr in delta county . 
the american veterans organization in michigan petitioned the michigan legislature to grant this designation , which was assigned under public act in . 
CD sections of us are part of the overall great lakes circle tour the segment from the wisconsin state line near to the m junction in wakefield is part of the lake superior circle tour , and the segment from the southern m junction in to the eastern terminus in st. ignace is part of the lake michigan circle tour . 
these CD tours were created in may through a joint effort between mdot and its counterparts in wisconsin , minnesota and ontario . 
the section of us between iron river and crystal falls has been named the iron county heritage trail . 
this pure michigan byway was designated to honor the rich history of CD industries that built a state and nation mining and logging . 
on august , , mdot announced that the section of us that runs concurrently with m in delta county was being included in the up coast recreational heritage trail . 
historic bridges 
there are CD bridges along current or former sections of us that mdot has added to its listing of michigan historic bridges CD of these are also listed on the national register of historic places . 
a third bridge added to the in late has not been added to mdot listing however . 
the first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the iron river , which has since been bypassed by a new bridge . 
the original structure , dating to , is a foot long CD arch span that was built by the mshd as trunk line bridge no . 
. 
the structure was listed on the on december , , for its architectural and engineering significance . 
in december , the national park service approved the listing of the upper twin falls bridge that crosses the river northwest of iron mountain . 
the structure is a single span , pin connected , , through bridge , and it is the only known example of its type in michigan . 
it was built between and because the twin falls power dam would flood an existing river crossing . 
the span cost , equivalent to , in , paid equally by dickinson and florence counties . 
until the , the upper twin falls bridge carried us across the river . 
in , a new bridge was built about a mile downstream , and the highway was rerouted over the new span . 
the bridge closed to automobile traffic in september , and the nomination process for inclusion on the national register of historic places began in . 
in , mdot replaced the sturgeon river bridge in township , dickinson county . 
as of october , even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced , mdot retained it on their historic bridge list . 
it was built in . 
before , us used a different routing through and crossed the river on what is nicknamed the bridge . 
built as a part of a on the river , the water level is actually higher than the road surface . 
this produces a effect , giving the bridge its nickname . 
the and paper company was organized in and needed a dam on the river to supply their mill . 
this dam would require a large section of the city to be flooded , and shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction . 
instead of expensive , a concrete tank was built in the river bed the sides of this tank provided man made banks higher than the natural banks . 
the michigan works progress administration described the bridge as having concrete bulkheads , formed by the side spans of the bridge , that allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed . 
the tourism council stated at CD time , the bridge itself was partially supported by the water that was forced under it , and that the bridge has been featured in ripley believe it or not 
. 
the CD span structure is feet m long . 
the cut river bridge carries us across the cut river in township , mackinac county . 
this structure was built during world war ii but completion was delayed due to war induced steel shortages . 
the span uses short tons long tons t of structural steel to bridge the feet m over the river and its at a height of feet m above the river . 
the cut river bridge is CD of only CD deck bridges in the state . 
on either side of the bridge , there are picnic areas and trails down to the river . 
listed on the on december , , the mackinac trail river bridge carries h , the modern successor to us , over the river north of st. ignace . 
the bridge is another arch structure feet m in length and built in . 
increasing traffic along mackinac trail prompted the mshd to widen its deck by CD feet . 
m and install new in the along with the addition of decorative retaining walls . 
the last of the historic bridges along a former segment of us is the structure carrying street bs i over the power canal in . 
marie . 
built in , it is CD of only CD steel arch bridges in the state . 
the foot wide m and foot long m structure is described by mdot as massive with an innovative construction method the previous structure was used as a for the current bridge before removal . 
major intersections 
mdot has erected along the CD michigan segments of the highway that use the total starting at the state line in the signs on the eastern segment reflect the in florence county , wisconsin . 
business route 
business u.s. highway bus . 
us is a . 
mile . 
km business route that runs from the wisconsin state line at the montreal river . 
the route extends through downtown on silver and aurora streets before turning northward along suffolk street . 
bus . 
us stays on suffolk street for a short while until it turns onto frederick street . 
on frederick street , bus . 
us bears north through a residential area along douglas street . 
the eastern terminus of the route is at its junction with us at the corner of drive and douglas street north of downtown . 
the business route was created in august when former m in was renumbered as a business loop of us . 
it was originally a bi state business connection before the wisconsin department of transportation decommissioned bus .

the same old story 
the same old story is the second episode of the first season of the american science fiction drama television series fringe . 
the episode was written by executive producer jeff pinkner and co creators j. j. abrams , alex , and roberto orci . 
when developing the series , they sought to find a medium between serialized drama and the crime procedural . 
the same old story was the first regular episode of fringe , and journalists viewed it as an example of what they could expect from the series .

production 
co creators j. j. abrams , alex and roberto orci , and executive producer jeff pinkner wrote the episode . 
paul a. edwards served as the director , his first such credit for the series . 
in developing fringe , the co creators did not want to make the series too serialized , as this was a complaint often directed at abrams television series . 
they wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content , and studied procedural dramas such as law and order and crime scene investigation for inspiration . 
explained , while we make sure that our episodes are self contained have a beginning , a middle , and an end the character stories can be serialized . 
they don t have to resolve themselves over the course of CD show . 
the same old story was fringe first regular episode , and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured . 
the episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series different departments . 
for the scene in which they remove the victim , the special effects crew created a mold based on actress elizabeth stanley head . 
using plaster to make a prosthetic , they drilled out the and ed it open and went through a series of molds . 
stanley stated that it really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me , even though it very gruesome because the popping out . 
the prop department rigged a weapon which they called a gun according to prop master peter , this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people clothing for concealed weapons . 
vfx supervisor christopher explained that for the eye last vision , they used a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location , which they then used to take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab . 
the same old story featured guest appearances by actors derek cecil as christopher and mark as his father , dr. claus . 
other guest actors included betty as amber daisy , bernie as old christopher , carmen as amy , jones as a doctor , and karin as john scott sister . 
reception 
ratings 
the same old story was watched by . 
CD viewers in the united states , a percent increase of CD CD from the pilot . 
fox claimed that this ratings improvement was the best for any new network drama series in over CD years . 
its high rated lead in , house , helped boost fringe ratings for the night , as percent of house total audience and percent of to year olds stayed to watch fringe . 
fringe was also the highest rated program for male to year olds that evening . 
reviews 
the same old story received mixed reviews from television critics . 
tv squad writer jane thought the episode seemed all over the place , and wasn t sure what to think . 
she stated the CD most interesting parts of the episode were when walter removed the girl eye in order to identity her killer , and the at the very end , when walter states if you ve read my file , then you know the truth about peter medical history . 
travis fickett of ign thought it was better than the pilot though it was laden with lots of and clichéd dialogue , fickett understood that it was needed to new viewers to the show . 
fickett concluded his review by saying fringe has the potential to be a great show , and he also praised the production level as top notch , and torv performance as very good as she brings a unique presence to the show . 
the a.v. 
club critic noel murray gave the episode a c , while television without pity graded it with a b. josh jackson of paste magazine disliked the ex aspects that solved the puzzles of the first CD episodes , and also criticized perceived plot like how the serial murderer immediately began aging once interrupted from killing his last victim . 
despite these flaws , jackson said he would tune in next week because he would rather have a show on the side of unbelievable than unremarkable , and i m interested to see if abrams has any more tricks up his sleeve . 
erin fox of tv guide also liked the same old story better than the pilot because she thought that it had really cool special effects , awesome walter , and actual chemistry forming between olivia and peter , and we also got to more into the connections between walter , nina sharp , massive dynamic and the government and the experiments they conducted before walter was . 
a ugo networks columnist was concerned that the expensive pilot would be hard to translate into weekly episodes , but after sitting down to watch fringe second episode , the same old story , my concerns have vanished . 
fringe second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without any of fringe CD herbs and spices . 
in fact , the subtle framework of what makes fringe not x files is even better defined in the first weekly episode . 
i struggled to find the word to describe it , and the winner is . 
the same old story has all of the sense of mystery , discovery , and humor that the pilot had just in a smaller , more space . 
another ugo writer , alex , later compared the same old story to the similarly plotted the x files episode . 
concluded that fringe wins this one , just for having a slightly less stupid explanation .

the consortium consisted of mark , charles , peter , david and chris . 
the mill and an acre of land cost , . 
restoration 
the mill was restored over a period of CD years . 
much of the work was carried out by enthusiasts who used working holidays to repair the mill . 
the consortium took possession of the mill in november . 
the first priority was to make the mill as as possible . 
sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure . 
the mill was surveyed and recorded . 
in spring , the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure . 
was erected to allow the to be dismantled , and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame . 
a CD week work in was held at the end of july and beginning of august . 
CD CD volunteers worked on the mill over the work in . 
CD new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from of pitch pine which had previously been in a at bury st . 
on august , the and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane , followed by the cap frame and the cast iron curb sections . 
new oak were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower . 
the bin floor was removed , apart from CD oak main beam which was . 
a replacement main beam was made from pitch pine , and the oak beam was repaired . 
new oak were fitted , along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused . 
CD of these had previously been a whip from a common sail . 
some of the were made from pitch pine from the , which , following its collapse on february , had been re erected at the museum of east anglian life , . 
the hoist was dismantled to enable its repair , brickwork was repaired , and new were made for some of the windows . 
a was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter . 
the on the bin floor were replaced and CD of the CD pairs of was removed . 
the work was financed by grants of from the council for the preservation of rural essex , from st borough council , from the trust , and from the suffolk mills group . 
other donations and income amounted to , with the balance of expenditure being met jointly by the CD owners . 
the work in was reported in both local and national media , including bbc look east , bury free press , eastern daily press , east anglian daily times , daily telegraph , and radio orwell . 
in the season CD separate work ins were held , the first from july to august and the second from august to august . 
a total of volunteers participated over the CD weeks . 
the were removed from the stone floor , which was then repaired . 
CD of the main beams was found to have been attacked by death watch beetles , and over a third of the beam was replaced with oak . 
the CD supports for the frame were repaired CD at a time , as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above . 
CD post required replacement . 
it had and the floor had sunk by inches mm causing the second main floor beam to fracture . 
when this work had been completed , the stone floor was removed , including the second main floor beam , which was removed in CD piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed . 
the new main beam for the stone floor was installed and the ground floor was . 
the stone floor was reconstructed , reusing the old stone bearers and those that were fit for reuse . 
other were made new from oak or pitch pine . 
new were laid in the dust floor , the inches mm thick boards being double grooved with a metal tongue between them . 
those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration . 
the top CD courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them , aided by a attached to the upright shaft . 
during the second work in , the remainder of the stone floor was boarded , again using double grooved boards with a metal tongue between them . 
the window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top CD courses of brickwork continued . 
the top CD courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks . 
the dust floor window had a reinforced concrete cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted . 
the , the curb segments and were given CD coats of red lead paint . 
a new for the cap was made from a piece of oak feet mm long by inches mm diameter . 
a start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and with mortar . 
after the work in had finished , the boarding of the stone floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn . 
the work done in cost , . 
received were , from , , from the historic buildings council and from st borough council . 
other donations and income received amounted to . 
the project received further coverage in local media , the eastern daily press , and south norfolk news . 
the work ins took place from july to august and august to august . 
the work planned included the completion of the brickwork at the top of the tower , installation of the curb , a start on the construction of the new cap , installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows . 
the cap frame was constructed , incorporating CD beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused . 
the cap frame was completed in autumn . 
it had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the into position . 
work in the early part of was mainly confined to smaller jobs such as casting various and overhaul of the various parts of the and mechanism for controlling the patent sails . 
the mill was generally made as safe as possible inside in preparation for scheduled visits , including CD from the wind and section of the society for the protection of ancient buildings . 
other work included the overhaul of the final drive to the feet inches . 
m stones , including the stone nut and replacement of CD in beech . 
when the weather improved , work commenced outside . 
the cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work in commenced . 
the work ins took place over CD separate weeks in july and august , with people participating . 
during the first work in , the posts and were fitted . 
the oak cap ribs , which had been prefabricated were fitted and the was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting . 
of oak were fitted and the was pulled into position using a . 
the cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and . 
the rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time . 
between the CD work ins , the rear was completed and the fitting of to the cap frame completed . 
this enabled a start to be made on boarding the cap on the monday of the second work in . 
the boards for the cap are inch mm thick and inches mm wide at the , towards the top . 
a new neck bearing was installed under the , not without difficulty and much before it would fit . 
when the boarding of the cap was completed , the cover strips were fitted over the joints . 
the was drawn into position using a rope and , and the steel reinforcing band into position , producing a structure . 
the striking rod was fitted through the and the axle for the fitted in position on top of the posts . 
at the top of the mill tower , the curb was prepared to accept the cap , and the cast iron curb track plates into position . 
of the brickwork of the tower continued , with nearly half of it completed at the end of the second work in . 
after the work ins had ended , work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for lift on in october . 
the weather hampered the work initially , but the application of a modern paint , designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain , was completed in time for the lift on . 
a mini work in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted , with people participating over the weekend . 
final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill . 
the was removed and the dismantled . 
the ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on october , watched by a crowd of some people . 
the fitting of the cap was with beer from , . 
restoration work in cost , . 
grants were received from the association of independent museums , norton women institute , ipswich historical transport society , the national association for children , mr d. porter and the society for the protection of ancient buildings . 
further income came from the sale of guide books and a drawing of the mill by . 
CD work ins were held during . 
the first CD were by from eastern electricity board . 
was chosen at the project to benefit from the young person development project for that year . 
had previously benefited from the project , and its owners , the suffolk preservation trust , had suggested that would be a good candidate for the scheme . 
CD separate parties spent a week each at the mill . 
a electricity supply was provided . 
an underground cable was laid with assistance from british telecom who were a thrust which had been developed at their research facility at heath . 
the thrust laid yards m of through which the cable was pulled into position . 
the mill was then supplied with lights and on each floor . 
other work undertaken by the involved repairing some damage to the foundation brickwork , digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position . 
a concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture , leading to rising . 
a french drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem . 
a horsepower kw diesel engine had been purchased in and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane . 
after fitting it was then painted . 
some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary . 
off site , the new brake wheel and were made . 
the original brake wheel was too rotten to repair , and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in . 
the original brake wheel was feet . 
m diameter to allow the common sails to run at their speed . 
when the mill was modernised in it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill , as patent sails run at a slower speed than common sails . 
the great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter . 
the brake wheel was also rebuilt , with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original , resulting in a wheel feet inches . 
m in diameter . 
the opinion of professional was sought , and it was decided that a scaled up version of the original brake wheel would be made , but retaining the cast iron teeth segments . 
the remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill . 
the original iron segments were all broken , so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat treated malleable cast iron . 
when the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for . 
the was made . 
some of the small were replaced . 
the stocks were made from pitch pine and the from douglas fir . 
work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows , with only CD window still needing attention when the first work in began . 
new beech were fitted to the crown wheel , which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft . 
the stocks and sails were made during the CD work ins held in july and august , a total of people attending over the CD weeks . 
a second hand stock had been bought in the and preserved at the mill , but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use . 
thus CD new stocks were required instead of CD . 
modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and grounds , leaving CD options . 
traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber , or stocks . 
good quality pitch pine was not in the lengths required . 
douglas fir was in such lengths but was discounted on strength and grounds . 
a douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had after only CD years . 
thus it was decided that stocks would be made . 
the feet . 
m long stocks were made from douglas fir . 
all timber had been pressure treated with and well . 
it was estimated that a stock would be up to stronger than a similar stock of solid timber . 
the timber used was inches mm thick and CD were required at the centre , where the stock passes through the poll end of the . 
attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber . 
both stocks were made during the work in , with CD of them being trimmed and finished ready for use . 
the stocks were the first stocks made by amateurs . 
the CD sails were made . 
the originals being slightly different pairs . 
those on the inner stock having bays of feet mm pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of feet inches mm pitch . 
it was decided that the new sails would be identical , at the larger pitch . 
CD feet . 
m long were cut from a of pitch pine obtained from a demolished at bury st . 
the are inches mm square at their inner end . 
bars and were made from modern pitch pine , selected for quality . 
the for the sail bars were cut . 
that at the heel of the sail being at and that at the tip being , decreasing by at each sail bar . 
CD of the CD sails had been completed at the end of the work in . 
the and associated was fitted to the mill . 
at the end of the second work in , the cap could be turned by means of the hand . 
the itself , with the painted red , white and blue was installed shortly afterwards . 
the arm brake wheel was assembled around the . 
it was found that the was eccentric on the upright shaft by inch mm . 
when this was corrected the brake wheel was within of an inch less than mm of true . 
the for the stocks were from a of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year . 
other work included a new frame for CD of the ground floor doors , cleaning and painting and further on the brickwork . 
the CD sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work in . 
the stock , with CD sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the and when in position and the had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock . 
the process was repeated for the second pair of sails . 
the mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work in . 
work later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail , balancing the and sorting out troubles with the . 
the brake and brake lever were made and installed and for the sails were cast . 
restoration work in cost , . 
grants received were , from english heritage , from st borough council , other donations amounted to . 
from open days at the mill came to . 
a boost to the funds was , from . 
this money had been allocated to allow the moving of a post mill buck to . 
in the end , the removal was not proceeded with , and mr allowed the donation to remain with the mill preservation trust . 
the project received further support in local media , including the east anglian daily times , CD of the work ins being featured on television about programme . 
work planned for included the replacement of the dust floor window and completion of the stocks and sails . 
the external walls of the mill were and internal walls plastered . 
CD work ins were held , from july to july and august to august . 
further work over the next CD years saw the restoration completed in . 
restoration team 
the restoration of was made possible by the efforts of individuals and organisations . 
this was achieved by the donation of labour , plant , materials or grants of money , or by giving for materials purchased or providing publicity for the project .

creek mountains 
the creek mountains are a remote , semi arid great basin mountain range mostly in southeastern oregon and partially in northern nevada in the united states . 
the range highest point is view , , feet , m above sea level , in nevada . 
disaster peak , elevation , feet , m , is another prominent summit in the nevada portion of the mountains . 
the mountains are characteristic of the great basin topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys . 
generally north to south , the creek mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt , which came from an ancient volcano and other , on top of older rocks . 
the southern end of the range , however , features many . 
as a whole , the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by and canyons . 
most of the range is public land administered by the federal bureau of land management . 
there is very little human development in the remote region cattle grazing and are the primary human uses but former mines at the produced some of the largest amounts of mercury in north america in the century . 
public lands in the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited . 
includes large of big sagebrush in addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands . 
sage grouse and mountain are CD bird species native to the range , and common mammals include and jackrabbits . 
despite the area dry climate , a few year round streams provide habitat for the rare trout . 
fish populations in the creek mountains declined throughout much of the century . 
in the , the effects of grazing on riparian zones and the fish led to land use conflict . 
the creek mountain working group was formed in to help resolve disagreements among livestock owners , environmentalists , government agencies , and other interested parties . 
the met and agreed on changes to land use practices , and since the early , riparian zones have begun to recover . 
geography 
the creek mountains are in a very remote area of southeastern oregon and northern nevada , in harney and humboldt counties . 
the nearest human settlements are the ranch , about miles km directly north from the middle of the mountains fields , oregon , about miles km to the northwest , nevada , about miles km to the west and , nevada oregon , about miles km to the east . 
the mountains are about miles km directly southwest of boise , idaho , and about miles km northeast of , nevada . 
the range and surrounding non mountainous areas cover an area of square miles , km2 . 
the mountains run miles km north to south and miles km east to west . 
more of the range is in oregon than in nevada . 
the highest point in the range is view , which is , feet , m above sea level and is located in nevada about CD mile south of the oregon border . 
about CD miles southeast of view is disaster peak , a large , symmetrical that is visible throughout the region . 
at , feet , CD , disaster peak anchors the southern end of the mountains in a sub range called the . 
the oregon canyon mountains border the creek mountains on the east along the harney county line according to the united states geological survey definitions , while the mountains are the next range west of the creek mountains . 
the creek mountains in both oregon and nevada border the creek mountains on the southwest the CD ranges are separated by cabin creek and south fork creek . 
south of the creek mountains is the kings river valley , which separates the creek mountains on the west from the montana mountains on the east . 
the terrain in the creek mountains varies from broad , flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock cut by deep canyons . 
the canyons have steep walls with loose slopes at the . 
there are meadows around springs in the mountains , although most streams in the range do not flow year round . 
major streams that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include from west to east creek , creek , creek , and creek . 
these streams all flow into basins in harney county , oregon . 
creek and creek are the largest of the CD . 
the kings river and creek each drain an area on the south slopes of the creek mountains . 
the kings river begins in the and flows south into nevada , where it meets the quinn river , which in the black rock desert . 
creek begins in oregon a few miles north of the and flows generally east , crossing the oregon nevada border CD times before disappearing into the floor of the quinn river valley south of . 
geology 
the mountains lie within the basin and range province or great basin of the western united states , which is characterized by a series of parallel fault blocks that form long north south mountain ranges separated by wide , high desert valleys . 
the creek mountains are and blocks with steep along the southern and eastern sides of the range . 
the southern area of the range , known as the , has numerous of cretaceous age granite . 
these granite are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic . 
the creek mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where mountain is today . 
thinning and the yellowstone , which was then beneath southeastern oregon , induced eruptions from and nearby about CD years ago , in the miocene . 
the produced a series of flows that spread across the land now known as the creek mountains . 
from the volcano lasted for about CD CD years , and at least separate flows occurred . 
under the resulting basalt rock lie much older rocks that may be related to some of the age formations of the blue mountains in northeastern oregon . 
within these rocks are and bodies which were presumably during the cretaceous period . 
the broad is a prominent geologic feature in the creek mountains . 
the oval shaped is a collapsed dome that the oregon nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the oregon canyon mountains . 
it is about miles km long and miles km wide . 
the dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early miocene .

the contains significant ore deposits , and mercury and uranium have been mined at CD or more sites in and around the . 
other areas in the were mined for ores of antimony , , and lithium . 
climate 
the creek mountains are semi arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west . 
when moist air from the pacific ocean moves eastward over the oregon and california coastal ranges and the cascade range , most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the creek mountains . 
as a result , the average annual precipitation in the creek mountains is only to inches to mm per year , with most areas receiving between and inches and mm annually . 
much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of march and the end of june . 
most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months . 
at elevations below , feet , m usually by april however , at the higher elevations , snow can remain until mid june .

there are also patches of mountain mahogany in some areas . 
common grass species include idaho , bluebunch wheatgrass , , western , , , and , as well as basin in some well drained areas . 
less than CD percent of the range consists of meadow wetlands and riparian vegetation along stream banks . 
however , these areas are vital to the local ecosystem . 
the meadows surround springs , which are mostly on gently sloping or in stream , and range in size from about to acres . 
to . 
ha . 
riparian follow the year round streams . 
many areas have and groves . 
and alder groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is and stream channels are wider . 
and rushes are also native to these stream . 
years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species , riparian vegetation , and young and trees . 
restoration of riparian areas began in the early , and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the and early . 
however , large in southeastern oregon during the summer of burned much of the range vegetation , damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle . 
fauna

several streams in the creek mountains are home to trout , including the rare trout subspecies . 
these include creek , creek , little creek , creek , fifteen mile creek , indian creek , sage canyon creek , line canyon creek , and some tributaries of creek . 
trout live in small , isolated populations that are often confined to individual streams , many of them in the creek mountains . 
these populations have significant genetic differences due to their history of isolation . 
for most of the century , the trout numbers declined considerably . 
it was listed under federal law as an endangered species in and was reclassified as threatened in . 
reasons for the fish decline included habitat degradation from cattle grazing , drought , , competition with other fish , and with introduced rainbow trout , which decreased the number of genetically pure trout .

land management compromise 
by the and , a century of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the riparian vegetation along stream banks in the creek mountains and elsewhere in the great basin . 
as a result , stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones . 
populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees , decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures . 
these conditions put the rare trout population at risk . 
since the was officially designated as a threatened species , environmental groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the creek mountains . 
beginning in the early , the bureau of land management identified damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas . 
approximately , trees were planted along streams , small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams , and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing . 
next , the agency sought to reform land use plans to change grazing practices , which became a complex and controversial project . 
as environmentalists pressed the to close much of the creek mountains to grazing , frustrated ranchers joined the rebellion seeking to protect their grazing . 
initially , it appeared that the issue of grazing in the range would produce prolonged litigation with appeals potentially lasting decades . 
however , in , interest groups representing all sides of the issue joined to form the creek mountain working group . 
the group goal was to find a solution acceptable to everyone a plan that would protect both the land ecological health and ranchers economic needs . 
initial members of the creek mountain working group included over the next several years , the group continued to meet and discuss options for restoring the land while meeting the economic needs of local ranchers . 
meetings were all open to the public . 
the group eventually endorsed a grazing management plan that provided for both the ecological health of sensitive riparian areas and the economic well being of ranchers . 
in , the ranch agreed to rest CD grazing totaling , acres , ha to restore critical stream and mountain pastures . 
the on fifteen mile creek was rested for CD years , and its creek pasture received a CD year rest before grazing was resumed . 
in addition , the grazing season in mountain pastures was reduced from CD months to CD , and the total number of cattle released in the areas was reduced from , to , . 
finally , sensitive areas were to protect them from cattle , and additional water sources were constructed away from streams . 
other also agreed to rest specific pastures including the creek , creek , and . 
in , the bureau of land management approved a new grazing management plan . 
it was based on the agreements made by the creek mountain working group , and it took effect in .

back off 
back off is a song by english musician starr , released as a non album single in march . 
starr former beatles george harrison produced the recording , which took place in london shortly after the CD had appeared together at harrison concert for bangladesh shows in august . 
the single was a follow up to starr hit song it don t come easy and continued his successful run as a solo artist . 
back off peaked at number in britain and canada , and number on america billboard hot . 
it remains starr highest charting single in the united kingdom . 
the title for the song was inspired by english singer songwriter marc . 
some commentators have suggested that the lyrics were directed at paul mccartney , reflecting starr disdain for the music mccartney had made as a solo artist over the previous CD years . 
back off demonstrates the influence of rock on starr , who directed a documentary film , born to boogie , about band t. rex around this time . 
described by CD author as a high energy in your face rocker , the song features a prominent slide guitar part by harrison and contributions from musicians gary wright and klaus . 
starr re recorded back off for his album stop and the roses , in a collaboration with american singer harry nilsson that incorporates lyrics from beatles songs such as with a little help from my friends , good day sunshine and baby , you a rich man . 
the original version has appeared on starr compilation albums from your past and the very best of starr , and as a bonus track on his remastered studio album vienna . 
since his return to touring in , starr has performed back off regularly in concert with the various of his all starr band . 
background and composition 
starr identified his initial inspiration for back off as having come from marc , the singer and guitarist with english rock band t. rex . 
in a interview with editor paul du , starr described as a dear friend who used to come into the office when i was running apple movies , a big office in town , and the hang out for myself , harry nilsson and keith moon . 
over dinner CD evening at starr home outside london , had used the word so often that it stuck in starr mind , after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight . 
when discussing the composition on vh1 in may , starr explained was an guy . 
he used to speak back off NFP you , . 
do you want some potatoes 
you , 
starr also recalled having to take the batteries out of his children toys that night , in order to power a tape recorder and make a recording of the new song . 
the lyrics to the middle CD of back off came to starr while watching london weekend television football show , the big match . 
the program host , jimmy hill , often referred to a footballer playing as , a catchphrase that starr incorporated into his song lyrics get yourself together now and give me something everything you try to do you know it sure sounds wasted . 
commentators have interpreted the song , and particularly this statement , as an attack by starr on his former beatles paul mccartney . 
starr has denied any such interpretation , instead claiming that the song was inspired by and nothing more , beatles biographer robert rodriguez writes . 
starr had publicly criticised mccartney solo albums mccartney and ram on release , and author bruce the message of the middle CD as a plea for paul to produce better music . 
the mention of sound ing wasted could also be a reference to mccartney with cannabis , rodriguez suggests . 
a further example of starr allegedly anti mccartney message exists in the song first verse wake up , don t pretend that you are dead get yourself up off the cart . 
the same commentators suggest that here starr could be referring to the paul is dead hoax . 
the latter circulated during september and october of that year while mccartney hid away on his scottish farm , after john lennon had told him and starr that he wanted a divorce from the beatles . 
in addition to these supposed messages in back off , observers have viewed the song title as starr to mccartney to abandon his legal stand against the beatles and apple corps , which was placed in receivership in march after a high court judge found in mccartney favour . 
author keith writes that had long been cited as paul nickname from his former bandmates starr , lennon and george harrison . 
while acknowledging that in subsequent years starr might have chosen to minimise any ill feeling towards mccartney , rodriguez notes that the lyrics just happened to fit perfectly into the us vs. paul mindset following the beatles break up , to the extent that back off was as as early had been . 
when his composition i m the greatest for starr to record on the album , lennon referenced the song title with the lines now i m only CD CD and all i want to do is . 
although t rex devotees , in the words of starr biographer alan , claimed that had ghost written back off , starr later acknowledged that harrison co wrote the song by adding some chords and finishing the melody . 
as on starr hit single it don t come easy , harrison was not credited for his songwriting contribution . 
starr originally offered back off to fellow black to record , but she declined , hoping instead to record another new starr harrison composition , .

together , joining heads .

this claim was first made by auschwitz survivor alexander at the trial of ss adolf the architect of the holocaust , where it was asserted that the veins together and turned them into twins .

when drummer lombardo left slayer in , the band hired a full time replacement in forbidden drummer paul . 
made CD mistake out of the CD songs the band him with , on angel of death . 
before the big double bass part there is a lead section , which could not understand , as he had to learn from live records recorded with lombardo .

the fees ranged from to a high of , for rush hours . 
in order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction , the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed . 
little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished . 
to save time and money , innovative construction methods were employed the original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans used to direct connect roads to be made of steel , but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction , cast in place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans . 
however , decided to use concrete segmental bridges , rather than casting the bridge elements in place , and used a unique machine , designed and constructed by deal of italy and costing about CD , to move the pieces into place . 
during the construction , . 
CD cubic yards of was used , , cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site , and , square feet of retaining walls were built . 
additionally , , feet of drilled shafts and , linear feet of drainage pipe were completed . 
in addition to the construction of permanent bridges , CD temporary bridges were built , resulting in . 
CD square feet of bridge deck . 
the project was designed by the corporation who provided professional engineering consultation throughout the construction , which had begun in and was completed in december , more than months sooner than planned .

she was launched on march and completed on july . 
her completion was delayed by about CD months when her bottom plating required repairs after running aground off following sea trials . 
the ship departed england , after repairs in portsmouth , on the day of her completion , and arrived at , japan , on october . 
asahi became flagship of the standing fleet on may and was assigned to the battleship division of the fleet when the combined fleet was re formed on december . 
at the start of the russo japanese war , asahi , commanded by captain , was assigned to the division of the fleet . 
she participated in the battle of port arthur on february , when vice admiral led the fleet in an attack on the russian ships of the pacific squadron anchored just outside port arthur . 
had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was , anticipating that the russians would be badly disorganized and weakened , but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack . 
the japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the russian defences . 
chose to attack the russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns . 
his fire proved to be a poor decision as the japanese CD inch mm and CD inch guns inflicted little damage on the russian ships , which concentrated all their fire on the japanese ships with some effect . 
although many ships on both sides were hit , russian casualties numbered only , while the japanese suffered killed and wounded before . 
asahi was not hit during the engagement . 
the ship participated in the action of april , when successfully lured out a portion of the pacific squadron , including vice admiral flagship , the battleship .

she was only hit by a single inch shell that wounded CD crewmen . 
both guns in her aft inch gun turret , however , were disabled by shells that detonated prematurely in their barrels . 
in turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships and although both ships were only lightly damaged by the japanese shells , which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact . 
the ship made the critical hits of the battle , however , when CD of her inch shells struck the bridge of , killing the russian squadron commander , vice admiral , CD of his staff officers and the ship . 
the ship wheel was jammed to port by wreckage and then slowed to a halt which threw the rest of the russian ships into total confusion . 
the second in command , rear admiral prince pavel , eventually gained control of the remainder of the squadron and headed back to port arthur . 
more than CD months later , on october , asahi struck a mine off port arthur while on blockade duty . 
damaged , she was under repair at naval arsenal from november to april . 
russian naval forces in the far east had been destroyed or by this time and the russians were forced to transfer ships from the baltic fleet that did not arrive until may . 
battle of 
at the battle of on may , asahi again followed the battleship into combat , this time against the second and third pacific squadrons . 
opened fire at the battleship , the russian flagship , at , and was joined by asahi and the armoured cruiser shortly afterwards . 
within an hour the japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the russian ship , badly wounded the fleet commander , vice admiral , knocked out her rear inch gun turret , and jammed steering so that she fell out of formation . 
the russian ships were concentrating their fire on during the early part of the battle and asahi was not damaged during this time . 
was able to cross the t of the russian squadrons . 
steering was later repaired , but she between the japanese and russian fleets several times later in the battle and was heavily damaged . 
asahi seems to have mostly engaged the battleships and in the late stages of the battle , although fuji fired the shots that caused the magazines to explode and sink her . 
asahi fired more CD inch shells , , than any other ship during the battle . 
in total , the ship was hit CD times during the battle , but none of them damaged her significantly . 
while asahi casualties are not precisely known , the japanese only lost men killed and wounded to all causes during the battle . 
the battle was a total japanese victory with CD russian battleships captured and incorporated into the .

military history of australia 
the military history of australia spans the nation year modern history , from the early australian frontier wars between and europeans to the ongoing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan in the early century . 
although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations , australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars , and war and military service have been significant influences on australian society and national identity , including the anzac spirit . 
the relationship between war and australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma . 
as british , the australian colonies participated in britain small wars of the century , while later as a dominion , and then an independent nation , australia fought in the first world war and second world war , as well as in the wars in korea , malaya , borneo and vietnam during the cold war . 
in the post vietnam era australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions , through the united nations and other agencies , including in the sinai , persian gulf , , somalia , east timor and the solomon islands , while more recently they have also fought as part of multi lateral forces in iraq and afghanistan . 
in total , nearly , australians died during the course of these conflicts . 
war and australian society 
for most of the last century military service has been CD of the single greatest shared experiences of white australian males , and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the century , it continues to influence australian society to this day . 
war and military service have been defining influences in australian history , while a major part of the national identity has been built on an conception of the australian experience of war and of , known as the anzac spirit . 
these ideals include notions of endurance , courage , ingenuity , humour , , and traits which , according to popular thought , defined the behaviour of australian soldiers fighting at gallipoli during the first world war . 
the gallipoli campaign was CD of the first international events that saw australians taking part as australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity . 
the relationship between war and australian society has been shaped by CD of the more enduring themes of australian strategic culture with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare . 
indeed , australian defence policy was closely linked to britain until the japanese crisis of , while since then an alliance with the united states has its security . 
, this pattern of both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs , as well as for more security concerns has ensured that australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies . 
regardless , a tendency towards strategic has also been evident , with australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to resources until a crisis arises a trait which has historically resulted in for major military challenges . 
reflecting both the realist and liberal of international relations and the conception of national interests , a number of other important themes in australian strategic culture are also obvious . 
such themes include an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics , the of notions of sovereignty , a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a of security , and the proposition that the status in international affairs should only be changed peacefully . 
likewise , , collective security and defence self reliance have also been important themes . 
change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic have persisted throughout its history , being the product of australian society democratic political tradition and christian anglo european heritage , as well its associated values , beliefs and economic , political and religious ideology . 
these are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely european island on the edge of the asia pacific , and the circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power . 
to be sure , during threats to the core australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result , it has frequently become involved in foreign wars . 
throughout these conflicts australian soldiers known colloquially as have often been noted , somewhat , for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities . 
colonial era 
british forces in australia , 
from until the defence of the australian colonies was mostly provided by british army regular forces . 
originally marines protected the early settlements at sydney cove and norfolk island , however they were relieved of these duties in by a british army unit specifically recruited for colonial service , known as the new south wales corps . 
the new south wales corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of irish convicts at castle hill in . 
soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the war office of the need for a more reliable garrison in new south wales and van land . 
chief of these shortcomings was the rum rebellion , a coup mounted by its officers in . 
as a result , in january the regiment of foot arrived in australia . 
by , british infantry regiments had served in australia , as had a small number of artillery and engineer units . 
although the primary role of the british army was to protect the colonies against external attack , no actual threat ever . 
the british army was instead used in policing , guarding convicts at penal institutions , combating , putting down convict rebellions as occurred at bathurst in and to suppress aboriginal resistance to the extension of european settlement . 
notably british soldiers were involved in the battle at the in on the victorian . 
members of british regiments stationed in australia also saw action in india , afghanistan , new zealand and the sudan . 
during the early years of settlement the naval defence of australia was provided by detached royal navy units of the east indies station , based in sydney . 
however , in australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a , marking the first occasion that royal navy ships had been permanently stationed in australia . 
the royal navy remained the primary naval force in australian waters until , when the australia station ceased and responsibility handed over to the royal australian navy the royal navy depots , dockyards and structures were given to the australian people . 
frontier warfare , 
the reactions of the native aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of british settlers in australia were varied , but were inevitably hostile when the settler presence led to competition over resources , and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants lands . 
european diseases decimated aboriginal populations , and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation . 
by and large neither the british nor the approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare . 
at times , however , the frontier wars did see the involvement of british soldiers and later mounted police units . 
not all aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands , while many served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes . 
fighting between and europeans was localised as the did not form capable of sustained resistance . 
as a result , there was not a single war , but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent . 
or disorganised however , a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with aboriginal resistance beginning in the century and continuing into the early century . 
this warfare the popular and at times academic myth of peaceful settlement in australia . 
faced with aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence , resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres . 
among the most famous is the battle of in western australia in . 
such incidents were not officially sanctioned however , and after the creek massacre in new south wales in CD europeans were hanged for their part in the killings . 
however , in tasmania the so called black war was fought between and , and aimed at driving most of the island native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas . 
although it began in failure for the british , it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population . 
it may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as CD sided and mainly by europeans on . 
although many more died than british , this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the europeans . 
aboriginal tactics varied , but were mainly based on pre existing hunting and fighting practices using , clubs and other primitive weapons . 
unlike the indigenous peoples of new zealand and north america , on the main failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the europeans . 
although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms , this was not widespread . 
the were never a serious military threat to european settlers , regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them . 
on occasions large groups of attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued , during which the would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage . 
this could sometimes be effective , with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents , waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their while the settlers . 
however , such open warfare usually proved more costly for the than the europeans . 
central to the success of the europeans was the use of firearms . 
however , the advantages afforded by firearms have often been . 
prior to the late century , firearms were often muzzle loading , smooth bore , single shot with flint lock mechanisms . 
such weapons produced a low rate of fire , while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within metres ft . 
these deficiencies may have initially given the an advantage , allowing them to move in close and engage with or clubs . 
yet by significant advances in firearms gave the europeans a distinct advantage , with the CD shot revolver , the single shot breech loading rifle and later the henry rifle , as well as rapid fire rifles such as the winchester rifle , becoming available . 
these weapons , when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of , often proved successful . 
the europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast moving , often hidden enemies . 
tactics employed included night time surprise attacks , and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks . 
the conflict lasted for over years and followed the pattern of british settlement in australia . 
beginning in new south wales with the arrival of the first europeans in may , it continued in sydney and its surrounds until the . 
as the frontier moved west so did the conflict , pushing into outback new south wales in the . 
in tasmania , fighting can be traced from to the , while in victoria and the southern parts of south australia , the majority of the violence occurred during the and . 
the south west of western australia experienced warfare from to . 
the war in queensland began in the area around brisbane in the and continued until , moving to central queensland in the and , and then to northern queensland from the to . 
in western australia , the violence moved north with european settlement , reaching the region by , with violent clashes continuing until the . 
in the northern territory conflict lasted even later still , especially in central australia , continuing from the to the . 
CD estimate of casualties places european deaths at , , while at least , are believed to have perished . 
far more devastating though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced the aboriginal population by the beginning of the century a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist . 
new zealand wars , 
war 
in , the victorian ship victoria was dispatched to help the new zealand colonial government in its war against māori in . 
victoria was subsequently used for patrol duties and logistic support , although a number of personnel were involved in actions against māori fortifications . 
CD sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during the deployment . 
invasion of the 
in late , the new zealand government requested troops to assist in the invasion of the province against the māori . 
settlement on confiscated land , more than , australians over half of whom were from victoria were recruited to form CD regiments . 
other australians became scouts in the company of forest rangers . 
despite experiencing conditions the australians were not heavily involved in battle , and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties . 
australians were involved in actions at , east , hill , and te . 
than were believed to have been killed in action . 
the conflict was over by , and the regiments disbanded in . 
however , many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade , while many others had returned to australia . 
colonial military forces , 
from until , each of the CD colonial governments was responsible for their own defence . 
the colonies had gained responsible government between and , and while the colonial office in london retained control of some affairs , the governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia . 
to do this , they were granted the authority from the british crown to raise military and naval forces . 
initially these were militias in support of british regulars , but when military support for the colonies ended in , the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities . 
the colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia , paid citizen soldiers , and a small permanent component . 
they were mainly infantry , cavalry and mounted infantry , and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline . 
even after significant reforms in the including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units they remained too small and to be considered armies in the modern sense . 
by , the forces numbered , men . 
although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the british empire during the century , with the colonies raising to serve in sudan , south africa and china . 
despite a reputation of colonial , many of the locally raised units were highly organised , disciplined , professional , and well trained . 
during this period , defences in australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery , based on garrisoned coastal forts . 
however , by the , improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led major general james edwards who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid of brigades of infantry . 
as a consequence he called for a of defences , and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies . 
edwards argued for the colonial forces to be and for professional units obliged to serve anywhere in the south pacific to replace the volunteer forces . 
these views found support in the influential new south wales commandant , major general edward hutton , however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards new south wales and victoria the proposal . 
these reforms remaining unresolved however , and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies . 
with the exception of western australia , the colonies also operated their own navies . 
in , victoria received its own naval vessel , victoria , and its deployment to new zealand in during the first war marked the first occasion that an australian warship had been deployed overseas . 
the colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo boats for the defence of harbours and rivers , as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts . 
victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies , with the ironclad cerberus in service from , as well as the steam sail warship hms nelson on loan from the royal navy , CD small gunboats and CD torpedo boats . 
new south wales formed a naval brigade in and by the start of the century had CD small torpedo boats and a . 
the queensland maritime defence force was established in , while south australia operated a single ship , hmcs protector . 
tasmania had also a small torpedo corps , while western australia only naval defences included the fremantle naval artillery . 
naval personnel from new south wales and victoria took part in the suppression of the rebellion in china in , while hmcs protector was sent by south australia but saw no action . 
the separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until federation in , when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new commonwealth of australia . 
sudan , 
during the early years of the , an egyptian regime in the sudan , backed by the british , came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native muhammad ahmad or ahmed , known as mahdi to his followers . 
in , as part of the war , the egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt , but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of their forces . 
the british instructed the egyptians to abandon the sudan , and sent general charles gordon to co the evacuation , but he was killed in january . 
when news of his death arrived in new south wales in february , the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent expenses . 
the new south wales consisted of an infantry battalion of men and officers , and an artillery battery of men and sailed from sydney on march . 
the contingent arrived in on march and were attached to a brigade that consisted of scots , and guards . 
they subsequently marched for in a large square formation made up of , men . 
reaching the village , they burned and returned to CD australians were wounded in minor fighting . 
most of the contingent was then sent to work on a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards , on the nile . 
the australians were then assigned to guard duties , but soon a camel corps was raised and men volunteered . 
they on a reconnaissance to on may and were heavily involved in a during which more than arabs were killed or captured . 
on may , they made CD last sortie to bury the dead from the fighting of the previous march . 
meanwhile , the artillery were posted at and drilled for a month , but they soon rejoined the camp at . 
eventually the british government decided that the campaign in sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison in . 
the new south wales sailed for home on may , arriving in sydney on june . 
approximately australians served in sudan CD subsequently died of disease during the return journey while CD had been wounded during the campaign . 
second boer war , 
british encroachment into areas of south africa already settled by the and the competition for resources and land that developed between them as a result , led to the second boer war in . 
pre the deployment of british forces , the of the orange free state and the republic under president paul declared war on october , striking deep into the british territories of natal and the cape colony . 
after the outbreak of war , plans for the dispatch of a combined australian force were subsequently set aside by the british war office and each of the CD colonial governments sent separate to serve with british formations , with CD squadrons each of men from new south wales and victoria , and CD each from the other colonies . 
the first troops arrived CD weeks later , with the new south wales who had been training in england before the war , diverted to south africa . 
on november , the came under fire for the first time near , and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties on them . 
following a series of minor victories , the british suffered a major setback during black week between december , although no australian units were involved . 
the first of infantry from victoria , south australia , western australia , and tasmania arrived in cape town on november and were designated the australian regiment under the command of colonel john charles . 
with a need for increased mobility , they were soon converted into mounted infantry . 
further units from queensland and new south wales arrived in december and were soon committed to the front . 
the first casualties occurred soon after at on january , after queensland mounted infantry and a column of canadians , british and artillery attacked a boer at . 
david and victor jones were killed when their patrol clashed with the boer forward . 
regardless , the were surprised and during CD hours of heavy fighting , more than were killed and another taken prisoner . 
CD CD and the new south wales subsequently took part in the siege of in february . 
despite serious set backs at , , , and in january and with still under siege the british mounted a CD division counter invasion of the orange free state in february . 
the attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by lieutenant general john french with the new south wales , queensland mounted infantry and new south wales army medical corps attached . 
first , was relieved following the battles of river and , and the retreating defeated at , with the new south wales mounted rifles locating the boer general , . 
the british entered on march , while was relieved . 
disease began to take its toll and scores of men died . 
still the advance continued , with the drive to in may including more than , australians . 
johannesburg fell on may , and the withdrew from on june . 
the new south wales mounted rifles and western australians saw action again at diamond hill on june . 
was relieved on may . 
following the defeat of the republics still the held out , forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt british troop movements and lines of supply . 
this new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the australian colonies and the raising of the , with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse riding and shooting skills , but little military experience . 
after federation in , CD australian commonwealth horse battalions of the newly created australian army were also sent to south africa , although they saw little fighting before the war ended . 
some australians later joined local south african irregular units , instead of returning home after discharge . 
these soldiers were part of the british army , and were subject to british military discipline . 
such units included the which gained notoriety as the unit in which harry and peter served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes . 
with the guerrillas requiring supplies , de la rey lead a force of , against , on the river in western . 
the post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by australians and . 
the attack began on august with heavy shelling causing casualties . 
during the night the defenders dug in , enduring shelling and rifle fire . 
a relief force was stopped by the , while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved . 
the siege lasted days , during which more than , shells were fired into the post . 
after calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders , and not prepared to risk a frontal attack , the eventually retired . 
the siege of river was CD of the major achievements of the australians during the war , with the post finally relieved on august . 
in response the british adopted counter insurgency tactics , including a earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops , the establishment of concentration camps for boer women and children , and a system of and field obstacles to limit boer mobility and to protect railway communications . 
such measures required considerable expenditure , and caused much bitterness towards the british , however they soon yielded results . 
by mid , the bulk of the fighting was over , and british mounted units would ride at night to attack boer or , overwhelming them with superior numbers . 
of warfare in last months of , the new south wales mounted rifles travelled , miles , km and were involved in , killing , wounding , and capturing for the loss of CD dead and wounded . 
other notable australian actions included , pink hill , and . 
australians were not always successful however , suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war . 
on june , the victorian mounted rifles lost killed and wounded at , near after poor security allowed a force of to surprise them . 
on october , of the scottish horse regiment also suffered heavy casualties at gun hill , although were also killed in the engagement . 
meanwhile , at on january , the queensland imperial lost killed and wounded . 
ultimately the were defeated , and the war ended on may . 
in all , australians served in south africa , and perhaps another , enlisted as individuals in imperial units casualties included killed in action , died of disease and missing in action , while a further were wounded . 
CD australians were awarded the victoria cross . 
rebellion , 
the rebellion in china began in , and a number of western nations including many european powers , the united states , and japan soon sent forces as part of the china field force to protect their interests . 
in june , the british government sought permission from the australian colonies to dispatch ships from the australian squadron to china . 
the colonies also offered to assist further , but as most of their troops were still engaged in south africa , they had to rely on naval forces for manpower . 
the force dispatched was a modest one , with britain accepting men from victoria , from new south wales and the south australian ship hmcs protector , under the command of captain william . 
most of these forces were made up of naval brigade , who had been trained in both ship handling and to fulfil their coastal defence role . 
amongst the naval contingent from new south wales were naval officers and sailors and permanent soldiers headquartered at victoria barracks , sydney who originally enlisted for the second boer war . 
the soldiers were keen to go to china but refused to be enlisted as sailors , while the new south wales naval brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks . 
the army and navy compromised and titled the contingent the marine light infantry . 
the from new south wales and victoria sailed for china on august . 
arriving in , the australians provided men to an , strong multinational force tasked with capturing the chinese forts at tang , which dominated a key railway . 
they arrived too late to take part in the battle , but were involved in the attack on the fortress at fu , where the chinese government was believed to have found after was captured by western forces . 
the joined a force of , men on a CD day march to the fort , once again only to find that it had already surrendered . 
the then garrisoned and the new south wales contingent undertook garrison duties in . 
hmcs protector was mostly used for survey , transport , and duties in the gulf of , before departing in november . 
the naval brigades remained during the winter , performing policing and guard duties , as well as working as and fire fighters . 
they left china in march , having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expeditions and in the restoration of civil order . 
CD australians died from sickness and injury , but none were killed as a result of enemy action . 
australian military forces at federation , 
the commonwealth of australia came into existence on january as a result of the federation of the australian colonies . 
under the constitution of australia , defence responsibility was now vested in the new federal government . 
the co ordination of australia wide defensive efforts in the face of imperial german interest in the pacific ocean was CD of driving forces behind , and the department of defence immediately came into being as a result , while the commonwealth military forces early forerunner of the australian army and commonwealth naval force were also soon established . 
the australian commonwealth military forces came into being on march and all the colonial forces including those still in south africa became part of the new force . 
, colonial soldiers , including , professional soldiers , , paid militia and , unpaid volunteers , were subsequently transferred . 
the individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial acts until the defence act brought all the units under CD piece of legislation . 
this act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes or serve outside australia . 
however , the majority of soldiers remained in militia units , known as the citizen military forces . 
major general sir edward hutton a former commander of the new south wales military forces subsequently became the first commander of the commonwealth military forces on december and set to work an integrated structure for the new army . 
in , following a report by lord the royal military college , was established , as was a system of universal national service . 
prior to federation each self governing colony had operated its own naval force . 
these navies were small and lacked blue water capabilities , forcing the separate colonies to the cost of a british naval squadron in their waters for decades . 
the colonies maintained control over their respective navies until march , when the commonwealth naval force was created . 
this new force also lacked blue water capable ships , and ultimately did not lead to a change in australian naval policy . 
in prime minister alfred deakin and , while attending the imperial conference in london , sought the british government agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an australian navy . 
the admiralty rejected and resented the challenge , but suggested that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient . 
deakin was unimpressed , and in invited the american great white fleet to visit australia . 
this visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of CD ton river class destroyers . 
the surge in german naval construction prompted the admiralty to change their position however and the royal australian navy was subsequently formed in , absorbing the commonwealth naval force . 
on october , the new fleet steamed through sydney heads , consisting of the battlecruiser australia , CD light cruisers , and CD destroyers , while several other ships were still under construction . 
and as a consequence the navy entered the first world war as a formidable force . 
the australian flying corps afc was established as part of the commonwealth military forces in , prior to the formation of the australian military forces in and was later separated in to form the royal australian air force , making it the second oldest air force in the world . 
regardless , the service branches were not linked by a single chain of command however , and each reported to their own minister and had separate administrative arrangements and government departments . 
first world war , 
of hostilities 
when britain declared war on germany at the start of the first world war , the australian government rapidly followed suit , with prime minister joseph cook declaring on august that NFP when the empire is at war , so also is australia and reflecting the sentiment of many australians that any declaration of war by britain automatically included australia . 
this was itself in part due to the large number of british born citizens and first generation anglo australians that made up the australian population at the time . 
indeed , by the end of the war almost of those who served in the australian forces had been born in britain . 
as the existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas under the provisions of the defence act , an all volunteer expeditionary force known as the australian imperial force aif was formed and recruitment began on august . 
the government pledged , men , organised as CD infantry division and CD light horse brigade plus supporting units . 
and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under plans drawn up in . 
the first commander was major general william bridges , who also assumed command of the division . 
throughout the course of the conflict australian efforts were predominantly focused upon the ground war , although small air and naval forces were also committed . 
occupation of german new guinea 
following the outbreak of war australian forces moved quickly to reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of germany pacific colonies . 
the australian naval and military expeditionary force , a man volunteer force separate from the aif and consisting of an infantry battalion plus naval and ex sailors , was rapidly formed under the command of william holmes . 
the objectives of the force were the wireless stations on , and those at yap in the caroline islands , and at rabaul in german new guinea . 
the force reached rabaul on september and occupied it the next day , encountering only brief resistance from the german and native defenders during fighting at and . 
german new guinea surrendered on september . 
australian losses were light , including CD killed during the fighting , but were compounded by the mysterious loss offshore of the submarine with all men aboard . 
gallipoli 
the aif departed by ship in a single convoy from albany on november . 
during the journey CD of the convoy naval escorts sydney engaged and destroyed the german cruiser sms at the battle of on november , in the first ship to ship action involving the royal australian navy . 
although originally bound for england to undergo further training and then for employment on the western front , the australians were instead sent to british controlled egypt to pre any turkish attack against the strategically important suez canal , and with a view to opening another front against the central powers . 
to knock turkey out of the war the british then decided to stage an amphibious at gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the australians were included amongst the british , indian and french forces committed to the campaign . 
the combined australian and new zealand army corps anzac commanded by british general william birdwood subsequently landed at anzac cove on the gallipoli peninsula on april . 
although promising to transform the war if successful , the gallipoli campaign was ill conceived and ultimately lasted CD months of bloody stalemate , without achieving its objectives . 
australian casualties totalled , , including , killed . 
for australians and new zealanders the gallipoli campaign came to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity . 
today , the date of the initial landings , april , is known as anzac day in australia and new zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations , as well as turkey , to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original , and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war . 
egypt and palestine 
after the withdrawal from gallipoli the australians returned to egypt and the aif underwent a major expansion . 
in the infantry began to move to france while the cavalry units remained in the middle east to fight the turks . 
australian troops of the anzac mounted division and the australian mounted division saw action in all the major battles of the sinai and palestine campaign , playing a pivotal role in fighting the turkish troops that were threatening british control of egypt . 
the australian first saw combat during the uprising in the desert and the nile valley , during which the combined british forces successfully put down the primitive pro turkish islamic sect with heavy casualties . 
the anzac mounted division subsequently saw considerable action in the battle of romani against the turkish between august , with the turks eventually pushed back . 
following this victory the british forces went on the offensive in the sinai , although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the suez canal . 
rafa was captured on january , while the last of the small turkish garrisons in the sinai were eliminated in february . 
the advance entered palestine and an initial , unsuccessful attempt was made to capture gaza on march , while a second and equally unsuccessful attempt was launched on april . 
a third assault occurred between october and november and this time both the anzac mounted division and the australian mounted division took part . 
the battle was a complete success for the british , over running the gaza beersheba line and capturing , turkish soldiers . 
the critical moment was the capture of beersheba on the first day , after the australian light horse brigade charged more than miles . 
km . 
the turkish trenches were overrun , with the australians capturing the wells at and securing the valuable water they contained along with over prisoners for the loss of killed and wounded . 
later , australian troops assisted in pushing the turkish forces out of palestine and took part in actions at ridge , jerusalem and the . 
the turkish government surrendered on october . 
units of the light horse were subsequently used to help put down a nationalist revolt in egypt in and did so with efficiency and brutality , although they suffered a number of fatalities in the process . 
meanwhile , the afc had undergone remarkable development , and its independence as a separate national force was unique among the . 
just a single aircraft to german new guinea in , the first operational flight did not occur until may however , when the half flight was called upon to assist in protecting british oil interests in iraq . 
the afc was soon expanded and CD squadrons later saw action in egypt , palestine and on the western front , where they performed well . 
western front 
CD infantry divisions of the aif saw action in france and belgium , leaving egypt in march . 
i anzac corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of on april and for the next CD and a half years the aif participated in most of the major battles on the western front , earning a formidable reputation . 
although spared from the disastrous first day of the battle of the somme , within weeks CD australian divisions had been committed . 
the division , positioned on the left flank , was the first in action during the battle of on july , suffering , casualties in a single day . 
the division entered the line on july , assaulting , and by the time that they were relieved by the division on july , they had suffered , casualties . 
mouquet farm was attacked in august , with casualties totalling , men . 
by the time the aif was withdrawn from the somme to re organise , they had suffered , casualties in just days . 
in march , the and divisions pursued the germans back to the hindenburg line , capturing the town of . 
on april , the division assaulted the hindenburg line in the disastrous first battle of , losing over , casualties and , captured . 
on april , the and divisions were counter attacked near and were forced to abandon the town , before it again . 
the division then took part in the second battle of , beginning on may , and succeeded in taking sections of the hindenburg line and holding them until relieved by the division . 
finally , on may the division relieved the , remaining in the line until the battle ended in mid may . 
combined these efforts cost , australian casualties . 
on june , the ii anzac corps along with CD british corps launched an operation in flanders to eliminate a salient south of ypres . 
the attack commenced with the detonation of a CD pounds , kg of explosives that had been placed underneath the ridge , destroying the german trenches . 
the advance was virtually unopposed , and despite strong german counterattacks the next day , it succeeded . 
australian casualties during the battle of included nearly , men . 
i anzac corps then took part in the third battle of ypres in belgium as part of the campaign to capture the plateau , between september and november . 
individual actions took place at road , wood , , and passchendaele and over the course of CD weeks fighting the australians suffered , casualties . 
on march the german army launched its spring offensive in a last effort to win the war , CD CD divisions over a miles km front . 
as the allies fell back the and divisions were rushed south to amiens on the somme . 
the offensive lasted for the next CD months and all CD aif divisions in france were engaged in the attempt to stem the tide . 
by late may the germans had pushed to within miles km of paris . 
during this time the australians fought at , , , wood , , and hamel . 
at hamel the commander of the australian corps , lieutenant general john monash , successfully used combined arms including aircraft , artillery and armour in an attack for the first time . 
the german offensive ground to a halt in mid july and a brief lull followed , during which the australians undertook a series of raids , known as . 
the allies soon launched their own offensive the hundred days offensive ultimately ending the war . 
beginning on august the offensive included CD australian divisions striking at amiens . 
using the combined arms techniques developed earlier at hamel , significant gains were made on what became known as the black day of the german army . 
the offensive continued for CD months , and during second battle of the somme the australian corps fought actions at , , , , and mont st quentin , before their final engagement of the war on october at . 
the aif was subsequently out of the line when the armistice was declared on november . 
in all , australians enlisted in the aif during the war and , served overseas . 
, were killed and another , were wounded a total casualty rate of . 
the financial cost to the australian government was calculated at , , . 
CD on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war , preserving the volunteer status of the australian force , but stretching the reserves of manpower available , particularly towards the end of the fighting . 
consequently , australia remained CD of only CD armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war . 
the war had a profound effect on australian society in other ways also . 
indeed , for many australians the nation involvement is seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor , while many of the notions of australian character and that exist today have their origins in the war . 
australians were awarded the victoria cross during the first world war . 
inter war years 
russian civil war , 
the russian civil war began after the russian provisional government collapsed and the party assumed power in october . 
following the end of the first world war , the western powers including britain intervened , giving half hearted support to the pro , anti white russian forces . 
although the australian government refused to commit forces , many australians serving with the british army became involved in the fighting . 
a small number served as advisors to white russian units with the north russian expeditionary force . 
repatriation in england , about australians subsequently enlisted in the british north russia relief force , where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed . 
the royal australian navy destroyer swan was also briefly engaged , carrying out an intelligence gathering mission in the black sea in late . 
other australians served as advisers with the british military mission to the white russian general , anton in south russia , while several more advised admiral in siberia . 
later , they also served in mesopotamia as part of and the mission , although these missions were aimed at preventing turkish access to the middle east and india , and did little fighting . 
although the motivations of those australian that volunteered to fight in russia can only be guessed at , it seems unlikely to have been political . 
regardless , they confirmed a reputation for and courage , winning the only CD victoria crosses of the land campaign , despite their small numbers . 
yet australian involvement was barely noticed at home at the time and made little difference to the outcome of the war . 
total casualties included killed and wounded , with most deaths being from disease during operations in mesopotamia . 
, 
in october , adelaide was called to the british solomon islands as part of a punitive expedition in response to the killing of a district officer and CD others by natives at on the island of on october , known as the massacre . 
arriving at on october , the ship proceeded to to protect the landing of CD platoons of troops , then remained in the area to provide personnel support for the soldiers as they searched for the . 
the ship personnel took no part in operations ashore , providing only logistic and communications support . 
adelaide returned to australia on november . 
spanish civil war , 
a small number of australian volunteers fought on both sides of the spanish civil war , although they predominantly supported the spanish republic through the international brigades . 
the australians were subsequently allocated to the battalions of other , such as the british battalion and the lincoln battalion , rather than forming their own units . 
most were radicals motivated by ideological reasons , while a number were spanish born migrants who returned to fight in their country of origin . 
at least australians volunteered , with only CD bull , a conservative who was later killed serving in the raf during the second world war known to have fought for general francisco franco nationalist forces . 
while a celebrated cause for the australian left particularly the communist party of australia and the trade union movement the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality . 
australian opposition to the republican cause was by on an anti communist basis , rather than a pro nationalist basis . 
, although individual right wing australians may have served with the nationalist rebels , they received no public support . 
service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time , however as the government received no reports of australians travelling to spain to enlist , no action was taken . 
consequently , returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the and services league of australia . 
although the number of australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries , at least were killed . 
second world war , 
europe and the middle east 
australia entered the second world war on september . 
at the time of the declaration of war against germany the australian military was small and for war . 
for a second australian imperial force aif began in mid september . 
while there was no rush of volunteers like the first world war , a high proportion of australian men of military age had enlisted by mid . 
CD infantry divisions were formed during and , CD of which were dispatched to the middle east . 
the raaf resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the commonwealth air forces through the empire air training scheme , through which almost , australians were trained during the war . 
the australian military first major engagements of the war were against italian forces in the mediterranean and north africa . 
during the light cruiser sydney and CD elderly destroyers dubbed the iron flotilla by nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels a title proudly accepted by the ships took part in a series of operations as part of the british mediterranean fleet , and sank several italian warships . 
the army first saw action in january , when the division formed part of the commonwealth forces during operation . 
the division assaulted and captured on january and on january , with tens of thousands of italian troops surrendering at both towns . 
the division took part in the pursuit of the italian army and captured on february . 
in late february it was withdrawn for service in greece , and was replaced by the division . 
the australian forces in the mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during . 
during april , the division , other elements of i corps and several australian warships formed part of the allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend greece from german invasion during the battle of greece . 
at the end of this campaign , the division was evacuated to egypt and crete . 
the force at crete subsequently fought in the battle of crete during may , which also ended in defeat for the allies . 
over , australians were captured in these campaigns , and the division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat . 
the germans and italians also went on the offensive in north africa at the end of march and drove the commonwealth force there back to near the border with egypt . 
the division and a brigade of the division were besieged at successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by british units in october . 
during june , the main body of the division , a brigade of the division and the i corps headquarters took part in the syria lebanon campaign against the french . 
resistance was stronger than expected australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the french in early july . 
the majority of australian units in the mediterranean returned to australia in early , after the outbreak of the pacific war . 
the division was the largest unit to remain in the middle east , and played a key role in the first battle of el during june and the second battle of el in october . 
the division returned to australia in early , but several raaf squadrons and warships took part in the subsequent tunisia campaign and the italian campaign from until the end of the war . 
the raaf role in the strategic air offensive in europe formed australia main contribution to the defeat of germany . 
approximately , australian airmen served in dozens of british and CD australian squadrons in raf command between and the end of the war . 
australians took part in all of command major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on german cities and targets in france . 
australian aircrew in command had CD of the highest casualty rates of any part of the australian military during the second world war and sustained almost percent of all australian deaths in combat , were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner . 
australian airmen in light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated in the liberation of western europe during and and CD raaf maritime patrol squadrons served in the battle of the atlantic . 
asia and the pacific 
from the australia defence thinking was dominated by british imperial defence policy , which was embodied by the singapore strategy . 
this strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at singapore from which a large british fleet would respond to japanese aggression in the region . 
to this end , a high proportion of australian forces in asia were concentrated in malaya during and as the threat from japan increased . 
however , as a result of the emphasis on co operation with britain , relatively few australian military units had been retained in australia and the asia pacific region . 
measures were taken to improve australia defences as war with japan in , but these proved inadequate . 
in december , the australian army in the pacific comprised the division , most of which was stationed in malaya , and CD partially trained and equipped divisions in australia . 
the raaf was equipped with aircraft , most of which were obsolete trainers , and the had CD cruisers and CD destroyers in australian waters . 
the australian military suffered a series of defeats during the early months of the pacific war . 
the division and raaf squadrons in malaya formed a part of the british commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller japanese invasion force which landed on december . 
the british commonwealth force withdrew to singapore at the end of january , but was forced to surrender on february after the japanese captured much of the island . 
smaller australian forces were also overwhelmed and defeated during early at rabaul , and in ambon , timor , and java . 
the australian town of darwin was heavily bombed by the japanese on february , to prevent it from being used as an allied base . 
over , australians were taken prisoner in early and endured harsh conditions in japanese captivity . 
the prisoners were subjected to , denied medical treatment and frequently beaten and killed by their guards . 
as a result , , australian prisoners died in captivity . 
the rapid allied defeat in the pacific caused many australians to fear that the japanese would invade the australian mainland . 
while elements of the imperial japanese navy proposed this in early , it was judged to be impossible by the japanese imperial general headquarters , which instead adopted a strategy of isolating australia from the united states by capturing new guinea , the solomon islands , fiji , samoa , and new caledonia . 
this fact was not known by the allies at the time , and the australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion . 
large numbers of united states army and army air forces units arrived in australia in early , and the australian military was placed under the overall command of general douglas macarthur in march . 
australians played a central role in the new guinea campaign during and . 
after an attempt to land troops at port moresby was defeated in the battle of the coral sea , the japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the owen stanley ranges and milne bay . 
australian army units defeated these offensives in the track campaign and battle of milne bay with the support of the raaf and usaaf . 
australian and us army units subsequently assaulted and captured the japanese bases on the north coast of papua in the hard fought battle of . 
the australian army also defeated a japanese attempt to capture the town of in january and went onto the offensive in the lae campaign in april . 
in late , the and divisions played an important role in operation , when they landed to the east and west of lae and secured the peninsula during the peninsula campaign and range campaign . 
the australian mainland came under attack during and . 
japanese submarines operated off australia from may to august and january to june . 
these attacks sought to cut the allied supply lines between australia and the us and australia and new guinea , but were unsuccessful . 
japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against allied bases in northern australia which were being used to mount the north western area campaign against japanese positions in the netherlands east indies . 
australia role in the pacific war declined from . 
the increasing size of the us forces in the pacific rendered the australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production . 
nevertheless , the government wanted the australian military to remain active , and agreed to macarthur proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns . 
in late , australian troops and raaf squadrons replaced us garrisons in eastern new guinea , new britain , and , and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining japanese forces there . 
in may , i corps , the australian first tactical air force and usaaf and usn units began the borneo campaign , which continued until the end of the war . 
these campaigns contributed little to japan defeat and remain controversial . 
following japan surrender on august australia assumed responsibility for occupying much of borneo and the eastern netherlands east indies until british and dutch colonial rule was restored . 
australian authorities also conducted a number of war crimes trials of japanese personnel . 
, australians enlisted during the war , while , served overseas . 
casualties included , killed and another , were wounded . 
victoria crosses were awarded to australians . 
post war period 
and peace time defence arrangements 
the of the australian military following the end of the second world war was completed in . 
plans for post war defence arrangements were on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force . 
it was envisioned that the royal australian navy maintaining a fleet that would include CD light fleet carriers , CD cruisers , CD destroyers , others ships in commission and another in reserved . 
the royal australian air force would have a strength of squadrons , including CD manned by the citizen air force . 
meanwhile , in a significant departure from previous australian defence policy which had previously relied on citizen forces , the australian army would include a permanent field force of , regulars organised into a brigade of CD infantry battalions with armoured support , serving alongside a part time force of , men in the citizen military forces . 
the australian regular army was subsequently formed on september , while the was re raised on july . 
occupation of japan , 
in the immediate post war period australia contributed significant forces to the allied occupation of japan as part of the british commonwealth occupation force , which included forces from australia , britain , india and new zealand . 
at its height in the australian component consisted of an infantry brigade , CD warships and CD fighter squadrons , totalling , personnel . 
the australian army component initially consisted of the brigade which arrived in japan in february and was based in prefecture . 
the CD infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the , and battalions of the royal australian regiment in , and the brigade became the brigade when it returned to australia in december , forming the basis of the post war regular army . 
from that time the australian army contribution to the occupation of japan was reduced to a single under strength battalion . 
australian forces remained until september when the ceased operations , although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the korean following the outbreak of the korean war in . 
the raaf component consisted of nos . 
, and squadrons as part of no . 
wing raaf flying p mustangs , initially based at from march , before transferring to in . 
however , by only no . 
squadron remained in japan . 
a total of CD warships served in japan during this period , including ships australia , hobart , shropshire , , , , murchison , , and , while ships , and also provided support . 
cold war 
early planning and commitments 
during the early years of the cold war , australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the western world and eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the united nations , or a coalition led by either the united states or britain . 
the middle east was considered the most likely area of operations for australian forces , where they would most likely operate with british forces . 
early commitments included the involvement of raaf aircrew during the berlin in and the deployment of no . 
wing raaf to malta in the mediterranean from to . 
meanwhile , defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a national service scheme in to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the army , raaf and . 
korean war , 
on june , the north korean army kpa crossed the border into south korea and advanced for the capital seoul , which fell in less than a week . 
north korean forces continued toward the port of pusan and CD days later the united states offered its assistance to south korea . 
in response the united nations security council requested members to assist in the north korean attack . 
australia initially contributed p mustang fighter bomber aircraft from no . 
squadron raaf and infantry from the battalion , royal australian regiment rar , both of which were stationed in japan as part of the . 
in addition , it provided the majority of supply and support personnel to the british commonwealth forces korea . 
the frigate , and the destroyer , were also committed . 
later , an aircraft carrier strike group aboard sydney was added to the force . 
by the time rar arrived in pusan on september , the north koreans were in retreat following the landings . 
as a part of the invasion force under the un supreme commander , general douglas macarthur , the battalion moved north and was involved in its first major action at battle of near on october , before advancing towards the river . 
further successful actions followed at on october and at on october . 
north korean casualties were heavy , while australian losses included their commanding officer , lieutenant colonel charles green , who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and succumbed to his wounds and died CD days later on november . 
meanwhile , during the last weeks of october the chinese had moved divisions of the people volunteer army across the river to reinforce the remnants of the kpa . 
by us and south korean intelligence , the army group crossed the border on october and penetrated up to kilometres mi into north korea , and were reinforced in early november by divisions from the army group in total divisions composed of , men . 
rar fought its first action against the chinese at on november . 
the fighting cost the battalion heavily and despite halting a chinese division the new battalion commander was dismissed in the wake . 
following the chinese intervention , the un forces were defeated in successive battles and rar was forced to withdraw to the parallel . 
a series of battles followed at on january , as the british and australians occupied defensive positions in an attempt to secure the northern approaches to the south korean capital . 
further fighting occurred at on february following another chinese advance , and later at san between march as the un resumed the offensive . 
australian troops subsequently participated in CD more major battles in , with the first taking place during fighting which later became known as the battle of . 
on april , chinese forces attacked the valley and forced the south korean defenders to withdraw . 
australian and canadian troops were ordered to halt this chinese advance . 
after a night of fighting the australians recaptured their positions , at the cost of men killed and wounded . 
in july , the australian battalion became part of the combined canadian , british , australian , new zealand , and indian commonwealth division . 
the second major battle took place during operation commando and occurred after the chinese attacked a salient in a bend of the imjin river . 
the commonwealth division counter attacked on october , capturing a number of objectives including hill and hill during the battle of maryang san after CD days the chinese retreated . 
australian casualties included dead and wounded . 
the then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the first world war , in which men lived in tunnels , redoubts , and forts behind barbed wire defences . 
from until the end of the war , rar held trenches on the eastern side of the division positions in the hills northeast of the imjin river . 
across from them were heavily fortified chinese positions . 
in march , australia increased its ground commitment to CD battalions , sending rar . 
this battalion remained in korea for months , before being replaced by rar in april . 
the australians fought their last battle during july , with rar holding off a chinese attack along the river and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of CD killed and wounded . 
were suspended on july . 
, australians served during the war , with killed , , wounded and captured . 
malayan emergency , 
the malayan emergency was declared on june , after CD estate managers were murdered by members of the malayan communist party . 
australian involvement began in june , when in response to a british request , CD from no . 
squadron and a flight of dakotas from no . 
squadron arrived in singapore to form part of the british commonwealth far east air force . 
the dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs , troop movement , as well as and drops , while the lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the communist terrorist ct jungle bases . 
the raaf were particularly successful , and in CD such mission known as operation , CD lincoln bombers destroyed communist camps , killed communists and forced CD into surrender , in a joint operation with the raf and ground troops . 
the were withdrawn in , and were replaced by canberra bombers from no . 
squadron and cac sabres from no . 
wing . 
based at raaf base they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas . 
australian ground forces were deployed to malaya in october as part of the far east strategic reserve . 
in january , the first australian ground forces were deployed on malaysian peninsula , consisting of the battalion , royal australian regiment rar . 
rar mainly participated in up operations over the next months , conducting extensive patrolling in and near the ct jungle bases , as part of british commonwealth brigade . 
contact with the enemy was and results small , achieving relatively few kills . 
rar left malaysia october to be replaced by rar . 
rar underwent CD weeks of jungle training and began driving insurgents back into the jungle of and . 
the new battalion extensively patrolled and was involved in food denial operations and ambushes . 
again contact was limited , although rar had more success than its predecessor . 
by late , operations against the were in their final phase , and most communists had been pushed back and across the thailand border . 
rar left malaysia october and was replaced by rar . 
though patrolling the border rar did not make contact with the insurgents , and in october it was replaced by rar , which stayed in malaysia until august . 
the malayan emergency officially ended on july . 
australia also provided artillery and engineer support , along with an air field construction squadron . 
the royal australian navy also served in malayan waters , firing on suspected communist positions between and . 
the emergency was the longest continued commitment in australian military history , australians served and died in malaya although only were on operations and another were wounded . 
military and naval growth during the 
at the start of the , prime minister robert greatly expanded the australian military so that it could carry out the government policy of forward defence in south east asia . 
in , announced a large increase in defence spending . 
the strength of the australian army would be increased by over CD years from , to , providing a full CD brigade division with CD battalions . 
the raaf and would also both be increased by . 
in , conscription or national service was re introduced under the national service act , for selected year olds based on date of birth , for a period of CD years continuous full time service the previous scheme having been suspended in . 
in , CD charles f. adams class destroyers were purchased from the united states to replace the ageing q class destroyers . 
traditionally , the had purchased designs based on those of the royal navy and the purchase of american destroyers was significant . 
perth and hobart joined the fleet in , followed by brisbane in . 
other projects included the construction of CD river class frigates , the conversion of the aircraft carrier melbourne to an anti submarine role , the acquisition of CD wessex helicopters , and the purchase of CD oberon class submarines . 
the raaf took delivery of their first fighters in , no . 
, no . 
and no . 
squadrons with them . 
the service also received american f strike aircraft , c transports , p orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft and italian trainers . 
indonesia malaysia , 
the indonesia malaysia confrontation was fought from to between the british commonwealth and indonesia over the creation of the federation of malaysia , with the commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state . 
the war remained limited , and was fought primarily on the island of borneo , although a number of indonesian and airborne incursions onto the malay peninsula did occur . 
as part of australia continuing military commitment to the security of malaysia , army , naval and units were based there as part of the far east strategic reserve . 
regardless the australian government was wary of involvement in a war with indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the malayan peninsula only . 
on CD occasions australian troops from rar were used to help up from and airborne incursions at and , in september and october . 
following these raids the government conceded to british and malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to borneo . 
during the early phases , british and malaysian troops had attempted only to control the malaysian indonesian border , and to protect population centres . 
however , by the time the australian battalion deployed the british had decided on more aggressive action , crossing the border into to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the to remain on the defensive , under the operation . 
the fighting took place in mountainous , jungle clad terrain , and a debilitating climate , with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border , cross border operations , the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply , and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine enemy movements and intentions . 
rar deployed to borneo in march , and served in until the end of july , operating on both sides of the border . 
the battalion had CD major contacts with indonesian forces and several smaller ones including at sungei , and during which they inflicted heavy casualties on the as well as suffering casualties in CD mine incidents . 
rar served a less eventful tour between april and august , and also operated over the border , successfully with the on a number of occasions . 
a squadron of the special air service regiment was also deployed in and again in , taking part in cross border operations and inflicting significant casualties on the , even though they were often tasked with covert reconnaissance . 
other units included artillery and engineers , while a number of ships were involved in shelling indonesian positions in borneo and in in the singapore strait . 
the raaf played a relatively minor role , although it would have been used far more extensively had the war escalated . 
operations in borneo were extremely sensitive and they received little press coverage in australia , while official acknowledgement of involvement in cross border missions only occurred in . 
following a military coup in indonesia in early which brought general to power , a peace treaty was signed in august which ended the conflict . 
, australians served during casualties included dead , with CD killed in action and CD wounded . 
vietnam war , 
australia involvement in the vietnam war was driven largely by the rise of communism in southeast asia after the second world war , and the fear of its spread which developed in australia during the and early . 
as a consequence , australia supported south vietnam throughout the early . 
in and , the leader of the south vietnamese government , , asked for assistance from the us and its allies in response to a growing insurgency supported by communist north vietnam . 
australia offered military advisors from the australian army training team vietnam , which became known simply as the team . 
they arrived in july and august , beginning australia involvement in the war . 
later in august , the raaf sent a flight of transport aircraft to the port city of . 
however , with the security situation in south vietnam continuing to deteriorate , the us increased its involvement to , combat troops by early . 
australia also committed ground forces , dispatching the rar to serve with the us airborne brigade in province in june and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions , including gang , operation and . 
in march , the australian government announced the deployment of a brigade sized unit the australian task force to replace rar . 
included were a large number of conscripts , under the increasingly controversial national service scheme . 
of CD infantry battalions as well as armour , aviation , artillery and other support arms , the task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was based at , in tuy province . 
included were the iroquois helicopters of no . 
squadron raaf . 
at the battle of long tan on august , d company , rar with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a viet cong force that was at least CD times bigger than itself . 
australians were killed and wounded , while communist dead were later recovered from the battlefield . 
the battle allowed the australians to gain dominance over tuy province and was not fundamentally challenged again . 
regardless , during february the australians suffered their heaviest casualties in the war to that point , losing men killed and wounded in a single week , the bulk during operation . 
yet with the tuy province coming progressively under control throughout , the australians increasingly spent a significant period of time conducting operations further afield . 
was subsequently deployed infiltration routes leading to saigon to communist movement against the capital as part of operation during the offensive and later during the battle of coral in may and june . 
at fire support coral and the australians had clashed with regular north vietnamese army and viet cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength for the first time in near conventional warfare , ultimately fighting their largest , most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war . 
during days of fighting australian casualties included killed and wounded , while communist casualties included killed confirmed by body count , possibly killed , wounded and captured . 
other significant australian actions included binh ba in june , in late december and early and long in june . 
at the height of the australian commitment , numbered , troops , including CD infantry battalions , armour , artillery , engineers , logistics and aviation units in support . 
a third raaf unit , no . 
squadron raaf , flying canberra bombers , was sent in , and CD destroyers joined us patrols in the waters off north vietnam . 
the australian withdrawal effectively commenced in november . 
as a consequence of the overall allied strategy of vietnamization and with the australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war , rar was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty . 
was again reduced to just CD infantry battalions , albeit with significant armour , artillery and aviation support remaining . 
australian combat forces were further reduced during as part of a phased withdrawal , and ceased operations in october . 
meanwhile , the advisors remained to train south vietnamese troops until withdrawn on december by the newly elected labor government of . 
the last australian forces were finally withdrawn in . 
the vietnam war was australia longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support , as the nation military involvement increased a vocal anti war movement developed . 
more than , australians served in vietnam were killed and , were wounded . 
CD were awarded the victoria cross . 
post vietnam era 
creation of the australian defence force , 
although the importance of joint warfare had been highlighted during second world war when australian naval , ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands , the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co ordination between the services in the post war era , with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine . 
the need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the australian military experiences in the vietnam war . 
in , the secretary of the department of defence , arthur , submitted a report to the government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of chief of the defence force staff . 
the labor government subsequently amalgamated the CD defence defence , navy , army , air force , and supply into a single department of defence in , while conscription under the national service scheme was abolished . 
on january , the CD branches of the australian military were brought together as a unified , all volunteer , professional force known as the australian defence force . 
today , the is headquartered at russell in canberra and is divided into air , land , maritime and special operations . 
in addition , northern command is based in darwin , and is responsible for operations in northern australia . 
defence of australia , and 
until the , australia military strategy centred on the concept of forward defence , in which the role of australian military and naval forces were to co operate with allied forces to counter threats in australia region . 
following the adoption of the guam doctrine by the united states in , and the british withdrawal east of suez in the early , australia developed a defence policy emphasising self reliance and the defence of the australian continent . 
known as the defence of australia policy , it focused australian defence planning on protecting the nation northern maritime approaches the air sea gap against possible attack . 
in line with this goal , the was to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from australian bases and to counter raids on continental australia . 
this was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the and raaf , and relocating regular army units to northern australia . 
during this time the had no military units on operational deployment outside australia . 
however , in the made its first operational deployment as part of operation morris dance , in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off fiji in response to the coups d . 
while broadly successful , this deployment highlighted the need for the to improve its capability to rapidly respond to events . 
during this period australia continued to retain forces in malaysia as part of the five power defence agreed in to defend it in the event of external attack , with this commitment initially including significant air , ground and naval forces . 
however , these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from singapore in , and the CD fighter squadrons in . 
since then a detachment of orion maritime patrol aircraft , support personnel , and an infantry company known as rifle company have been maintained , as well as occasional deployments of f a fighter aircraft . 
australian submarines were reportedly also involved in a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout asian waters in the last decades of the cold war . 
and navy units were also involved in tracking soviet ship and submarine movements in the region . 
since then the have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of operation gateway , conducting patrols over the indian ocean , strait of and south china sea . 
they have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights . 
gulf war , 
australia was a member of the international coalition which contributed military forces to the gulf war , deploying a naval task group of CD warships , a support ship and a clearance diving team in total about personnel . 
the australian contribution was the first time australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure . 
however , the australian force did not see combat , and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against iraq following the invasion of kuwait . 
some personnel serving on exchange with british and american units did see combat , and a few were later decorated for their actions . 
following the war , the navy regularly deployed a frigate to the persian gulf or red sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to iraq . 
a number of australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with us and british air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no fly zones imposed over iraq between and . 
global security , late 
since the late , the australian government had increasingly called upon the to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world . 
while most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists , several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel . 
large peacekeeping deployments were made to in early , cambodia between and , somalia in , between and and in and from onwards . 
the election of the howard liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the force structure and role , with the new government defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co operation with regional states and australia allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of australia global security interests . 
in line with this new focus , the force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the combat effectiveness . 
new millennium 
east timor , 
the former portuguese colony of east timor was invaded by indonesia in , however , following years of violent struggle the new indonesian government of president subsequently agreed to allow the east to vote on autonomy in .

design

nick and workplace is the bullpen , which was designed to enhance the discomfort and anxiety of lower level employees clustered in the center of the room where every movement is monitored by the boss from his corner office . 
the design team met with financial and management companies to learn about the architecture of their office layouts to visually represent the experience of starting from a low ranking position in a and aspiring to an office .

it highly designed , with rich and tones , artwork and subtle lighting all very till you step into her private office . 
the close , the door locks and you think , it the temple of doom .

was represented by an office building in , california , with the crew building the set on a vacant floor . 
for chemical , the production team found a perfect landscape of pipes and containers in santa fe springs , surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility . 
to take advantage of the surrounding imagery , the warehouse required an extensive series of , including cutting windows into concrete walls and creating new to allow for visuals of the warehouse exterior and provide a setting for the final scene of sutherland character . 
a friday in woodland hills , los angeles , was used as a bar frequented by nick , dale , and kurt , while the bar scene where they meet with jones was staged in downtown los angeles .

to achieve this aim , he decided against recording digitally , instead recording the tracks on CD inch analog tape , intending each musical cue to sound as if it was emanating from a vinyl record . 
he explained , the idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album . 
it isn t over produced or and digital in any way . 
it , noisy , and full of and . 
i knew that if we could some of this sonic magic in the score , then the and confidence of the music would play against bateman , sudeikis , and charlie day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that . 
continued , we tracked through tape before pro tools to get that fat sound , and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection . 
we even used the same that money mark played on beck classic where it at . 
at the end of the day , seth gordon and i wanted to produce a score that is as and full of attitude as the movie itself .

air rhodesia flight 
air rhodesia flight was a scheduled passenger flight that was shot down by the zimbabwe people revolutionary army on september , during the rhodesian bush war . 
the aircraft involved , a vickers viscount named the , was flying the last leg of air rhodesia regular scheduled service from victoria falls to the capital salisbury , via the resort town of . 
soon after flight took off , a group of guerrillas scored a direct hit on its starboard wing with a soviet made surface to air infrared missile , critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing . 
an attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of was by an unseen ditch , which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up . 
of the passengers and CD crew , died in this crash the insurgents then approached the wreckage , rounded up the survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire . 
CD passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush , while a further CD lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived . 
leader joshua publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the in an interview with the bbc today programme the same evening , saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes , but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground . 
the majority of , both black and white , saw the attack as an act of terrorism . 
a fierce white rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies , with many whites becoming and suspicious of blacks in general , even though few black supported attacks of this kind . 
reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as time magazine , but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments , much to the rhodesian government . 
between and prime minister ian smith , which had been progressing , were immediately suspended by the furious , with smith calling a monster . 
on september , smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas . 
the rhodesian security forces launched several retaliatory strikes into zambia and mozambique over the following months , attacking both and its rival , the zimbabwe african national liberation army zanla . 
the attack on in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions . 
CD months later , in february , shot down air rhodesia flight , another civilian flight , in an almost identical incident . 
background 
a dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self governing colony of rhodesia or southern rhodesia led the colonial government , headed by prime minister ian smith , to declare independence from the united kingdom on november . 
the idea of no independence before majority rule had recently gained ground in britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation , and rhodesia government was dominated by the country white minority , so the unilateral declaration went internationally . 
britain and the united nations imposed economic sanctions on rhodesia . 
CD rival communist backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule the chinese aligned zimbabwe african national union , mostly comprising , created the zimbabwe african national liberation army zanla and adopted aspects of doctrine , while the dominated zimbabwe african people union , aligned with soviet style and the warsaw pact , mobilised the zimbabwe people revolutionary army . 
these guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the second against the rhodesian government and security forces . 
the resulting conflict , the rhodesian bush war , began in earnest in december , when zanla attacked and in north eastern rhodesia . 
after the security forces mounted a successful counter insurgency campaign during and , developments overseas caused the conflict momentum to shift in the insurgents favour . 
the leftist carnation revolution of april caused portugal to withdraw its key economic support for smith administration , and led to mozambique independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with . 
around the same time , rhodesia other main , south africa , adopted a initiative that forced a ceasefire , giving the guerrillas time to regroup . 
following the abortive victoria falls conference of august , smith and the leader joshua held unsuccessful talks between december and march . 
and announced in october , during the run up to the unsuccessful geneva conference in december , that they would attend conferences as a joint patriotic front . 
in march , smith and non militant nationalist groups headed by bishop , the reverend and chief jeremiah agreed what became the internal settlement . 
this created a joint black white transitional government , with the country due to be reconstituted as zimbabwe rhodesia in june , pursuant to elections . 
and were invited to participate , but refused dubbed smith black colleagues the blacksmiths . 
proclaimed to be the year of the people as the war continued . 
officials from united african national council , sent to the provinces to explain the internal settlement to rural blacks , were killed by marxist guerrillas . 
also began to target christian missionaries , in the killing of CD british missionaries and CD children at mission near the mozambican border on june . 
the transitional government was badly received abroad , partly because the internal settlement kept control of law enforcement , the military , the judiciary and the civil service under white control . 
no country recognised rhodesia interim administration . 
smith again worked to bring into the government , hoping this would lend it some domestically , prompt diplomatic recognition overseas , and help the security forces defeat zanla . 
starting on august , he attended secret meetings with in , zambia where was based , doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation . 
attempts were made to also involve the leader robert , but would have no part in the talks . 
according to the south african military historian , negotiations between smith and progressed well and seemed on the verge of success by the start of september . 
on september , smith and revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place . 
incident 
prior threats to rhodesian air traffic 
rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about , in the latter stages of the war before this time , neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target . 
the weapon that made such attacks feasible for was the shoulder launched surface to air missile launcher , supplied by the soviet union from the mid as part of the warsaw pact materiel support . 
by september , there had been reported attempts to shoot down rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons , none of which had been successful . 
some rhodesian air force dakotas had been hit , but all had survived and landed safely . 
no civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the bush war . 
flight 
air rhodesia was the country national airline , established by the government on september to succeed central african airways , which was dissolved at the end of that year . 
based at salisbury airport , air rhodesia flight network during the late comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo flights , as well as international services to the south african cities of johannesburg and durban . 
the flight aircraft was a vickers viscount , a british made turboprop aircraft with CD engines on each wing . 
it was named the after the river of the same name , which flowed between lake and the rhodesian capital salisbury . 
the was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between victoria falls and salisbury , stopping over in the resort town of . 
despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on by guerrillas on the northern side of the in zambia , the resort had endured as CD of rhodesia choice tourist destinations . 
the flight on september , sunday afternoon , from to salisbury carried CD crew members and passengers , most of whom were from salisbury , returning home after a weekend at the lake . 
the flight took off from airport on schedule soon after central africa time . 
flight was by year old captain john hood , a native of who had gained his commercial pilot licence in . 
he had flown for air rhodesia since , and had also served in the rhodesian air force on a voluntary basis . 
his first officer , garth beaumont , was years old , and had lived in rhodesia for most of his life , having immigrated as a child from south africa . 
the CD air were , years old and from , and year old louise pearson , from salisbury . 
a group of guerrillas , armed with a launcher , waited in the bush beneath flight , and fired on the about CD minutes after it took off , while the aircraft was still in the climb phase of its flight . 
the heat seeking missile hit the plane starboard wing and exploded , causing the inner engine to also explode . 
a fuel tank and hydraulic lines , creating a fire that the passengers and crew could not put out . 
the second starboard engine failed almost immediately , leaving hood with only his CD port engines . 
wildly , the began to descend rapidly . 
at captain hood sent a distress call to air traffic control , informing them that he had lost the CD starboard engines and was going to crash . 
we going in , he . 
his passengers to for an emergency landing , he aimed for an open field of cotton in the hills , in the bush to the west of , intending to belly land the craft . 
the landing was relatively stable until the hit a previously unseen ditch , and exploded . 
the remaining fuel tanks and caught fire , setting the wrecked cabin . 
massacre on the ground 
of the people on board , , including hood and beaumont , died in the crash . 
CD survived , albeit with injuries , and climbed out of the wreckage . 
after briefly settling the others , CD of the passengers , dr cecil , led CD others young robert and shannon , mrs sharon , and her CD year old daughter tracey off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water . 
the other remained close to the wreckage . 
meanwhile , CD guerrillas made their way towards the crash site , and reached it at about . 
CD of the survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching rhodesian army anthony hill , , took cover in the surrounding bush , while businessman hans hansen and his wife diana did the same . 
this left passengers in full view near the wreckage , including CD women and CD girls aged and . 
the guerrillas , who were armed with ak rifles , presented themselves to the passengers as friendly , saying they would summon help and bring water . 
they spoke in english , both to the survivors and among themselves . 
they told the passengers to around a point a few metres from the wreckage when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk , the insurgents told the able bodied men to carry the others . 
the passengers were assembled into an area of about square metres sq ft . 
standing roughly metres ft away , the cadres now raised their weapons . 
you have taken our land , CD of them said . 
please don t shoot us 
CD of the passengers cried , just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire . 
having collected water from the nearby village , and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots . 
it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat , they continued on their way , and called out to the other passengers , who they thought were still alive . 
this alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors CD of the guerrillas told group to come here . 
the insurgents then opened fire on their general location , prompting and the others to flee . 
hill and the also ran they revealed their positions to the fighters in their , but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge . 
after hill and the others had hidden there for about CD hours , they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about . 
the guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the around the site , filled their arms with various passengers belongings , then left again . 
the survivors were found over the following days by the rhodesian army and police hill and mr and mrs hansen were taken to hospital , while and his group were to andrew fleming hospital in salisbury . 
claims responsibility , but denies killing survivors

he said that he had received intelligence that the was being used for military purposes . 
said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party policy to kill civilians , and denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground by contrast , he said that his men had helped them , and had left them alive . 
he also accused air rhodesia of troops and war materiel for the government , an allegation that captain pat travers , air rhodesia general manager , called a downright , deliberate lie . 
according to , a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of , was implying that responsibility for the massacre actually lay with security force pseudo guerrillas , more specifically the mixed race scouts unit , which had often been accused of rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion . 
asserts that the massacre cannot be put beyond the scouts , and also supports claim that the had been used militarily , suggesting that might have believed there to be rhodesian soldiers on board . 
rhodesian television , before attacks on zanla in mozambique , had shown ferrying paratroopers for the job , he writes , NFP and intelligence knew there were paratroopers stationed at victoria falls . 
reactions 
white turn against blacks 
a report published in the american magazine time a fortnight later described the incident as a genuine horror story , calculated to make the most of rhodesian seem true . 
indeed , the white community in rhodesia heard the news with , and many turned their minds to exacting for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism . 
the prominent indian rhodesian family was particularly affected by the incident , having lost CD members in the attack . 
though rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash , doing so only after CD days investigation , the truth was common knowledge in salisbury within hours . 
smith wrote in his memoirs that the degree of anger : was difficult to control . 
white south africans were similarly enraged , particularly after reports appeared in the south african press that the had raped the female passengers before them . 
a friends of rhodesia society in south africa offered a reward of to anybody who would either kill or bring him to salisbury to stand trial . 
geoffrey , who was then CD of the few black reporters at the rhodesia herald newspaper , later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became and wary towards blacks in general , believing them all to be terrorist . 
describing the herald the night of the incident , he relates a collective temper among the white sub editors they cursed until their voices became , threatening dire consequences for all and or ... 
i that some of the more derogatory remarks made in loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears . 
several racially motivated incidents occurred over the following days . 
according to the time article , a group of whites entered an salisbury bar fingering the of rifles and forced blacks drinking there to leave . 
time also reported a that CD white youths , on learning of the massacre , shot the first black man they saw . 
smith says that several would be groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to make the local people pay for their crime of and assisting the terrorists . 
he instructed them not to , according to his memoirs , telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme , and that it would not do to attack them . 
many also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments , especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target . 
memorial service , september 
at a memorial service held on september for flight passengers and crew at salisbury anglican cathedral , about , people crowded inside , with another standing outside on the steps and pavement , many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets . 
among those present in the cathedral were air rhodesia and south african airways personnel , as well as rhodesian special air service soldiers and senior officers from other military units . 
smith and several government ministers also attended , including p k van der , the co minister of foreign affairs . 
dean john de costa gave a sermon what he described as a silence from overseas . 
nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but at the events attending the viscount , he said . 
but are we with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves 
we are not 
like men in the story of the good , they pass by on the other side ... 
the of this ill flight from will be burnt upon our memories for years to come . 
for others , far from our borders , it is an intellectual matter , not CD which affects them deeply . 
here is the tragedy 
smith talks halted 
the talks between smith and the leader that had been progressing so were immediately halted by salisbury . 
smith himself called a monster . 
comments that the ending of the smith talks at this time was potentially the most serious result of the viscount massacre , as the talks had been progressing well before the incident . 
he that an agreement between the CD at this critical stage might have helped the transitional rhodesian government to secure international recognition . 
on september , the prime minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of martial law , which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed . 
he declared rhodesia intent to the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism , and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for any defensive strikes we might undertake against guerrilla bases in their respective territories . 
he claimed that the war had escalated because britain and the united states were supporting the patriotic front . 
william irvine , the co minister of transport , warned the guerrillas that rhodesia w not let these go . 
rhodesia strikes back

production 
mouth was directed by andrew , and was written by walt , paul , and williams . 
and also served as storyboard directors , and carson , william and erik worked as storyboard artists . 
series creator stephen has described the episode plot as a classic thing all kids go through . 
much of the storyline for the episode was inspired by the writers own experiences from childhood . 
the episode originally aired on in the united states on september , . 
the episode marks the introduction of mr. mother , mama , who was voiced by former creative producer and current executive producer paul . 
the writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for this episode . 
the idea for mouth was inspired by creative director derek experience when i got in trouble for saying the f word in front of my mother . 
said , the scene where patrick is running to mr. to , with chasing him , is pretty much how it happened in real life . 
the end of the episode , where mr. uses more than and patrick , was also inspired by the fact that my mother has a sailor mouth herself . 
the scene where and patrick playing a game of and , which is a parody of and , was difficult for the crew to , since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location . 
according to the series season dvd commentary , it was planned to have a scene that had saying go noise yourself followed by patrick saying noise you too 
during the and game . 
it was removed in the final episode check because it would have been inappropriate for the younger audience . 
mouth was released on the dvd compilation called sea stories on march , .

on september , , mouth was released on the the first episodes , alongside all the episodes of seasons CD through CD .

nancy of ranked the episode at number CD for her list of the top episodes . 
she said mouth just barely missed being in the number CD slot . 
praised the episode plot and called it genius NFP because children can relate to the forbidden of using curse words , and adults can laugh at the parody of tv censorship . 
in an interview with paul , CD of the episode writers , he told that mouth is his second favorite episode . 
criticism and controversy 
according to a report titled wolves in , which documents the increase in potentially violent , , and sexual content in children programming , the parents television council , a media group , and fans believed the episode mouth was an implicit attempt to promote and use of among children . 
the episode originally aired during the television season , ironically the season in which the ptc named among the best programs on cable television , but the report cited a repeat broadcast of the episode from to prove its point that it promoted use of among children . 
in a later report , several members of the ptc listed mouth as an example of how levels of , sexual , and violent activity has increased in children television programming . 
, in response to the incident , said it sad and a little desperate that they to literally putting language in the mouths of our characters to make a point . 
has the fcc looked at this 
richard of the new york daily news criticized the report for an episode of , mouth , over its intent to implicitly . 
al in modern is the ruins of an ancient city found in a in guatemala . 
, a gum , reported the ruins to la , a newspaper , which named the site . 
after the berlin academy of sciences magazine republished the report in , and treasure hunters began visiting the forest . 
today tourism to the site may help protect the . 
it is CD of the largest archaeological sites and urban centers of the pre columbian maya civilization . 
it is located in the archaeological region of the basin in what is now northern guatemala . 
situated in the department of el , the site is part of guatemala national park and in it was declared a unesco world heritage site . 
was the capital of a conquest state that became CD of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient maya . 
though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the century bc , reached its during the classic period , c . 
to ad . 
during this time , the city dominated much of the maya region politically , economically , and militarily , while interacting with areas throughout such as the great metropolis of in the distant valley of mexico . 
there is evidence that was conquered by in the century ad . 
following the end of the late classic period , no new major monuments were built at and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned . 
these events were coupled with a gradual population decline , culminating with the site s abandonment by the end of the century . 
is the best understood of any of the large lowland maya cities , with a long dynastic ruler list , the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments , temples and palaces . 
etymology 
the name may be derived from in the maya language it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning at the . 
the name was apparently applied to CD of the site ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers in the region . 
it has alternatively been interpreted as meaning the place of the voices in the maya language . 
, however , is not the ancient name for the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the . 
inscriptions at the ruins refer to the ancient city as or , meaning first . 
may have come to have been called this because also came to use the same emblem glyph the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name . 
the kingdom as a whole was simply called , which is the reading of the hair bundle emblem glyph seen in the accompanying photo . 
its precise meaning remains obscure . 
location 
the closest large modern settlements are flores and santa , approximately kilometres mi by road to the southwest . 
is approximately kilometres mi north of guatemala city . 
it is kilometres mi south of the contemporary maya city of and kilometres mi northwest of . 
the city was located kilometres mi southeast of its great classic period rival , , and kilometres mi northwest of ally , now in belize . 
the city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater than square kilometres . 
sq mi that included about , structures . 
the topography of the site consists of a series of parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands . 
the major architecture of the site is clustered upon areas of higher ground and linked by raised spanning the swamps . 
the area around has been declared as the national park and the preserved area covers square kilometres sq mi . 
the ruins lie among the tropical rainforests of northern guatemala that formed the of lowland maya civilization . 
the city itself was located among abundant fertile upland soils , and may have dominated a natural east west trade route across the peninsula . 
trees at the park include gigantic the sacred tree of the maya tropical cedar , and honduras mahogany . 
regarding the fauna , , white , gray foxes , spider monkeys , monkeys , eagles , falcons , , , , green parrots and ants can be seen there regularly . 
, , and cougars are also said to in the park . 
for centuries this city was completely covered under jungle . 
the average annual rainfall at is , millimetres . 
in . 
CD of the largest of the classic maya cities , had no water other than what was collected from and stored in CD reservoirs . 
archaeologists working in during the century refurbished CD of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use . 
the national park covers an area of . 
square kilometres . 
sq mi . 
it was created on may under the auspices of the de e historia and was the first protected area in guatemala . 
population 
population estimates for vary from , to as high as , inhabitants , with the most likely figure being at the upper end of this range . 
the population of began a continuous curve of growth starting in the period approximately bc ad , with a peak in the late classic with the population growing rapidly from ad through to , followed by a sharp decline . 
for the square kilometres sq mi area falling within the defenses of the hinterland , the peak population is estimated at per square kilometer per square mile . 
in an area within a kilometres . 
mi radius of the site core , peak population is estimated at , population density is estimated at per square kilometer per square mile . 
in a region within a kilometres mi radius of the site core and including some satellite sites , peak population is estimated at , with a density of per square kilometer per square mile . 
these population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture . 
however , some archaeologists , such as david webster , believe these figures to be far too high . 
rulers 
the dynastic line of , founded as early as the century ad , spanned years and included at least rulers . 
history 
there are traces of early agriculture at the site dating as far back as bc , in the middle . 
a of ceramics dating from about bc were found in a sealed , a subterranean bottle shaped chamber . 
major construction at was already taking place in the late period , first appearing around bc , including the building of major pyramids and platforms , although the city was still by sites further north such as el and . 
at this time , participated in the widespread culture that dominated the central and northern maya areas at this time a region that included the entire peninsula including northern and eastern guatemala and all of belize . 
CD temples dating to late times had masonry walled that may have been vaulted , although this has not been proven . 
CD of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a background , painted in yellow , black , pink and red . 
in the century ad rich burials first appeared and underwent a political and cultural as its giant northern neighbors declined . 
at the end of the late , the style art and architecture from the pacific coast began to influence , as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the and early murals at the city . 
early classic 
rulership among the lowland maya is most deeply rooted at . 
according to later hieroglyphic records , the dynasty was founded by , perhaps in the century ad . 
at the beginning of the early classic , power in the maya region was concentrated at and , in the core of the maya . 
may have benefited from the collapse of the large states such as el . 
in the early classic rapidly developed into the most dynamic city in the maya region , the development of other nearby maya cities . 
the site , however , was often at war and inscriptions tell of and conflict with other maya states , including , , and . 
the site was defeated at the end of the early classic by , which rose to take place as the paramount center in the southern maya lowlands . 
the earlier part of the early classic saw hostilities between and its neighbor , with recording the capture of prisoners from . 
there appears to have been a breakdown in the male succession by ad , when lady conducted a ending ceremony , apparently as queen of the city . 
and 
the fourteenth king of was ich aak great jaguar . 
ich aak built a palace that was preserved and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the central acropolis . 
little is known about ich aak except that he was killed on january ad . 
on the same day , k fire is born arrived from the west , having passed through el peru , a site to the west of , on january . 
on stela he is named as lord of the west . 
k was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non maya of a combined with an owl , a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis of in the distant valley of mexico . 
owl may even have been the ruler of . 
these recorded events strongly suggest that k led a invasion that defeated the native king , who was captured and immediately executed . 
k appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction at itself roughly at the time of the conquest , a group of natives were apparently residing near the lost world complex . 
he also exerted control over other cities in the area , including , where he became king , but did not take the throne of for himself . 
within a year , the son of owl by the name of i first crocodile had been installed as the tenth king of while he was still a boy , being enthroned on september . 
he reigned for years as king of , and remained a vassal of k for as long as the latter lived . 
it seems likely that i took a wife from the , defeated , dynasty and thus the right to rule of his son , chan k awiil ii . 
, a small site kilometres mi northeast of , was conquered by the latter during the reign of i. 
the site became an outpost of , shielding it from hostile cities further north , and also became a trade link to the caribbean . 
although the new rulers of were foreign , their descendants were rapidly . 
became the key ally and trading partner of in the maya lowlands . 
after being conquered by , rapidly dominated the northern and eastern . 
, together with smaller towns in the region , were absorbed into kingdom . 
other sites , such as and de san josé near lake became vassals of their more powerful neighbor to the north . 
by the middle of the century had a core territory of at least kilometres mi in every direction . 
around the century an impressive system of fortifications consisting of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of hinterland , joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of lying to the east and west of the city . 
additional fortifications were probably also built to the south . 
these defenses protected core population and agricultural resources , an area of approximately square kilometres sq mi . 
recent research suggests that the earthworks served as a water collection system rather than a defensive purpose . 
and 
in the century the power of the city reached as far south as , whose founder k inich k mo was clearly connected with . 
itself was not in an ethnically maya region and the founding of the dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of . 
k inich k mo arrived in in december and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at . 
an individual known as k mo lord k mo is referred to in an early text at and may well be the same person . 
his tomb had characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior of . 
texts refer to him as lord of the west , much like k . 
at the same time , in late , founded the nearby site of , possibly sponsored by itself . 
the founding of these CD centers may have been part of an effort to impose authority upon the southeastern portion of the maya region . 
the interaction between these sites and was intense over the next CD centuries . 
a long running rivalry between and began in the century , with each of the CD cities forming its own network of mutually hostile against each other in what has been likened to a long running war between CD maya . 
the kings of these CD capitals adopted the title , a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies something akin to high king . 
the early century saw another queen ruling the city , known only as the lady of , who was very likely a daughter of ich aak ii . 
she seems never to have ruled in her own right , rather being partnered with male co rulers . 
the first of these was b , who seems to have had a long career as a general at before becoming co ruler and in the dynastic sequence . 
the lady of herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering . 
it appears she was later paired with lord bird claw , who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown ruler . 
. 
late classic 
hiatus 
in the mid century , seems to have allied with and defeated , closing the early classic . 
the hiatus refers to a period between the late to late century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large scale construction at . 
in the latter half of the century ad , a serious crisis the city , with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture . 
this hiatus in activity at was long unexplained until later identified that the period was prompted by comprehensive defeat at the hands of and the polity in ad , a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of . 
the badly eroded altar at described how suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in april . 
it seems that was an ally of in the wider conflict between that city and , with the defeat of having a lasting impact upon the city . 
was not sacked but its power and influence were broken . 
after its great victory , grew rapidly and some of population may have been forcibly relocated there . 
during the hiatus period , at least CD ruler of took refuge with of palenque , another of victims . 
itself during long hiatus period . 
the beginning of the hiatus has served as a marker by which archaeologists commonly the classic period of chronology into the early and late classic . 
and 
in founded , some kilometres mi to the southwest , as a military outpost in order to control trade along the course of the river . 
b chan k awiil was installed on the throne of the new outpost at the age of CD , in , and for many years served as a loyal vassal fighting for his brother , the king of . 
roughly CD years later was attacked by and was soundly defeated . 
b chan k awiil was captured by the king of but , instead of being sacrificed , he was re instated on his throne as a vassal of his former enemy , and attacked in , forcing chaak , the then king of , to temporarily abandon the city . 
the first CD rulers of continued to use the emblem glyph of , and they probably felt that they had a legitimate claim to the throne of itself . 
for some reason , b chan k awiil was not installed as the new ruler of instead he stayed at . 
against in , driving b chan k awiil into an exile that lasted CD years . 
tried to encircle within an area dominated by its allies , such as el peru , and . 
in , chan k awiil i erected the first dated monument at in years and claimed the title of , so ending the hiatus . 
he initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on when , in , he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered . 
after this , never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory . 
after 
by the century , there was no active presence at any maya site and the center of had been razed by . 
even after this , formal war attire illustrated on monuments was style . 
chan k awiil i and his heir in chan k awiil continued hostilities against and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around , extending as far as the territory around lake . 
these CD rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today . 
in , , a vassal of , key ally in the south , switched allegiance to , defeated and gained its own independence . 
it appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of to bring about the collapse of southern allies . 
this upset the balance of power in the southern maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of . 
in the century , the rulers of collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the north acropolis . 
by the late century and early century , activity at slowed . 
architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers . 
terminal classic 
by the century , the crisis of the classic maya collapse was sweeping across the region , with populations and city after city falling into silence . 
increasingly endemic warfare in the maya region caused supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself , accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and corresponding environmental decline . 
construction continued at the beginning of the century , with the erection of temple , the last of the city major pyramids and the erection of monuments to mark the k in . 
the beginning of the in passed , and marks the beginning of a year hiatus , probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city . 
during this hiatus , satellite sites traditionally under control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the emblem glyph , with apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence . 
in , k awiil is mentioned on a stela at as visiting that city as the divine lord of but he is not recorded elsewhere and once great power was little more than a memory . 
the sites of and had by now inherited the once exclusive emblem glyph . 
as and its hinterland reached peak population , the area suffered , erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels . 
and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost the majority of its population during the period from to and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly . 
there is not much evidence from that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the maya region during the terminal classic , although an influx of refugees from the region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources . 
in the latter half of the century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much diminished city of , as evidenced by a stela erected in the great plaza by chan k awiil ii in . 
this was the last monument erected at before the city finally fell into silence . 
the former satellites of , such as and , did not last much longer , their final monuments in . 
by the end of the century the vast majority of population had deserted the city , its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple dwellings were being erected in the city ceremonial . 
the squatters blocked some in the rooms they in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non items such as musical instruments . 
these inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them . 
some monuments were and some were moved to new locations . 
before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared , with the tombs of the north acropolis being explored for and the easier to find tombs being looted . 
after , was all but deserted , although a remnant population may have survived in interspersed among the ruins . 
even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the or centuries and the claimed the ruins for the next CD years . 
some of population may have migrated to the lakes region , which remained heavily populated in spite of a in population levels in the first half of the century . 
the most likely cause of collapse at is and agrarian failure . 
the fall of was a blow to the heart of classic maya civilization , the city having been at the forefront of courtly life , art and architecture for over a CD years , with an ancient ruling dynasty . 
however , new research regarding from the reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of . 
modern history 
in , the spanish hernán cortés passed within a few kilometres of the ruins of but did not mention them in his letters . 
after spanish friar de became lost in the forests in early he described a ruin that may well have been . 
as is often the case with huge ancient ruins , knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region . 
it seems that local people never about and they guided expeditions to the ruins in the . 
some second- or third hand accounts of appeared in print starting in the century , continuing through the writings of john lloyd stephens in the early century stephens and his illustrator frederick heard rumors of a lost city , with white building tops towering above the jungle , during their travels in the region . 
because of the site from modern towns , however , no explorers visited until and , respectively the commissioner and the governor of , visited it in . 
artist accompanied them and their account was published in germany in . 
several other expeditions came to further investigate , map , and photograph in the century including alfred p. in and the early century . 
archaeologists started to clear , map and record the ruins in the . 
in , a small airstrip was built at the ruins , which previously could only be reached by several days travel through the jungle on foot or mule . 
in the project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the maya area . 
from through , major archaeological excavations were carried out by the university of pennsylvania project . 
they mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures . 
excavations directed by edwin m. and later by william coe of the university investigated the north acropolis and the central plaza from to . 
the project recorded over monuments at the site . 
in , the government began a further archeological project at , which continued through to .

site description 
has been partially restored by the university of pennsylvania and the government of guatemala . 
it was CD of the largest of the classic period maya cities and was CD of the largest cities in the americas . 
the architecture of the ancient city is built from limestone and includes the remains of temples that tower over metres ft high , large royal palaces , in addition to a number of smaller pyramids , palaces , residences , administrative buildings , platforms and inscribed stone monuments . 
there is even a building which seemed to have been a jail , originally with wooden bars across the windows and doors . 
there are also CD courts for playing the , including a set of in the CD temples plaza , a unique feature in . 
the limestone used for construction was local and on site . 
the depressions formed by the extraction of stone for building were plastered to them and were used as reservoirs , together with some natural depressions . 
the main were surfaced with stucco and laid at a gradient that rainfall into a system of canals that fed the reservoirs . 
the residential area of covers an estimated square kilometres sq mi , much of which has not yet been cleared , mapped , or excavated .

sq mi area around the site core has been intensively mapped it may have enclosed an area of some square kilometres sq mi see below . 
population estimates place the demographic size of the site between , and , , and possibly , in the surrounding area . 
recently , a project exploring the defensive earthworks has shown that the scale of the earthworks is highly variable and that in many places it is as a defensive feature . 
in addition , some parts of the were integrated into a canal system . 
the of varies significantly in coverage from what was originally proposed and it is much more complex and than originally thought . 
by the late classic , a network of linked various parts of the city , running for several kilometres through its urban core . 
these linked the great plaza with temple located about metres , ft to the west and the temple of the about kilometre .

these broad were built of packed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and archaeologists the maler , , and . 
they assisted the passage everyday traffic during the rain season and also served as dams .

architectural groups 
the great plaza lies at the core of the site it is flanked on the east and west sides by CD great temple pyramids . 
on the north side it is bordered by the north acropolis and on the south by the central acropolis . 
the central acropolis is a palace complex just south of the great plaza . 
the north acropolis , together with the great plaza immediately to the south , is CD of the most studied architectural groups in the maya area the project excavated a massive trench across the complex , thoroughly investigating its construction history . 
it is a complex group with construction beginning in the period , around bc . 
it developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the classic period , with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures . 
after ad a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier northern platform , which measured by metres by ft , gradually hiding it from view . 
CD temple pyramids were built in the century ad , each of them had an elaborate and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods . 
by the century ad , stelae and altars had been erected in the north acropolis of these monuments were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits . 
the north acropolis continued to receive burials into the period . 
the south acropolis is found next to temple v. it was built upon a large basal platform that covers an area of more than , square metres , sq ft . 
the plaza of the seven temples is to the west of the south acropolis . 
it is bordered on the east side by a row of nearly identical temples , by palaces on the south and west sides and by an unusual triple ballcourt on the north side . 
the mundo is to the west of the plaza of the CD temples . 
it is the largest ceremonial complex dating from the period at . 
the complex was organized as a large e group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a platform to the east that supported CD temples . 
the mundo complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history . 
by ad its architectural style was influenced by the great metropolis of in the valley of mexico , including the use of the form . 
during the early classic period c . 
the mundo became CD of the twin of the city , the other being the north acropolis . 
from ad to it may have served as the royal necropolis . 
the mundo complex was given its name by the archaeologists of the university of pennsylvania it is centered upon the lost world pyramid and a small platform to the west of it . 
group g lies just south of the causeway . 
the complex dates to the late classic and consists of palace type structures and is CD of the largest groups of its type at . 
it has CD stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor , a total of vaulted chambers . 
the remains of CD further chambers belong to the upper storey . 
CD of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask . 
group h is centered on a large plaza to the north of the great plaza . 
it is bordered by temples dating to the late classic . 
there are CD twin pyramid at , CD of which was completely dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed . 
they vary in size but consist of CD pyramids facing each other on an east west axis . 
these pyramids are flat topped and have on all CD sides . 
a row of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids , and lying roughly from them , there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair . 
on the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with CD . 
the entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at year or k intervals during the late classic . 
the first twin pyramid complex was built in the early century in the east plaza . 
it was once thought that these complexes were unique to but rare examples have now been found at other sites , such as and , and they may reflect the extent of political dominance in the late classic . 
group q is a twin pyramid complex , and is CD of the largest at . 
it was built by ii in in order to mark the end of the k . 
most of it has been restored and its monuments have been re erected . 
group r is another twin pyramid complex , dated to . 
it is close to the maler causeway .

they are not unlike europeans , a scottish reporter wrote in november that is their resemblance is great when one remembers that they were a savage tribe no further back than a generation . 
the surrey match , which was by the rfu secretary george rowland hill , was won by the after they scored CD tries . 
the next defeated both and kent , before defeats by and burton on trent . 
both defeats were unexpected , and in the match , injuries played a part the tourists played most of the match at least CD men down , as replacements were then not allowed . 
the team recovered to win their next game , against midlands counties in birmingham . 
their next fixture was against middlesex in a match not open to the public , and hosted by the earl of sheffield at sheffield park , . 
the middlesex side contained a number of international players , including arthur gould . 
middlesex won easily , with the play characterised by poor tackling . 
the final score was , with CD tries conceded by the new zealanders . 
prior to the match both sides had enjoyed lunch with wine an indulgence the were not used to . 
a report in the auckland star had this to say of the game the new zealanders expected to meet a mere exhibition of scratch players , whereas mr rowland hill had carefully collected the best possible team available . 
such passing as the home men displayed the admit they have never previously witnessed . 
said whilst we were on the platform waiting for the london train , i think they would have just beaten us , even if we had been in good form . 
following the match against middlesex , the team travelled to the north , where the strongest english rugby teams were based . 
yorkshire and lancashire dominated the county championship until many of their respective member clubs split from the rfu in over the issue of broken time payments . 
the new zealanders lost to hull , defeated , then lost to wakefield . 
after their first draw of the tour against northumberland county they defeated stockton on and . 
joe appeared in the match against , but aggravated the foot injury that had kept him out of the side until that point . 
these victories were followed by a defeat to halifax on november . 
the team then won CD matches in a row , including CD against rfc , their only scottish opposition of the tour . 
the last CD matches that month were a loss to and a victory over liverpool and district . 
the team had played CD fixtures during november and won CD of them . 
by this point , the team was beset by injuries of the CD players that played against county on november , CD had injuries . 
the squad comprised only players , and the tourists were often struggling to field a side . 
nevertheless , their heavy schedule continued on november they left for dublin , where a match had been organised against the ireland national team . 
ireland , further english matches , and wales 
the ireland fixture was played at lansdowne road , dublin , on december . 
both teams had a number of leading players out injured the irish were forced to make CD changes to their original selection . 
ireland led at half time after scoring a converted try , but the improved considerably in the second half , scoring CD tries . 
patrick scored the first CD tries , and his play was praised by the local press . 
the third try scored was by thomas after a counter attack by george williams . 
the try was not converted , but the strong finish from the new zealanders gave the visitors a victory . 
the irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team , but ireland did go on to defeat wales CD tries to nil in the home nations championship . 
following their defeat of ireland , the played trinity college and then north of ireland . 
the match against trinity college was drawn , and despite not playing , the native side played much better than their previous fixture . 
the team then travelled to belfast , where they defeated north of ireland on december scoring CD tries to nil . 
after returning to england , the faced lancashire in manchester , where they lost . 
CD days later they drew with bulldogs , despite their opposition scoring CD tries . 
their next match was against yorkshire , who were CD of the strongest counties in the country , and went on to win the inaugural county championship that season . 
yorkshire fielded a weakened team , and were subsequently defeated by the , who scored CD tries . 
after a further CD victories , the team travelled to wales , where they lost to , before facing wales on december . 
at the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the welsh team due to fans of both swansea and feeling slighted by the lack of selection of their players . 
CD teams dominated welsh international selection at the time , and out of the man team only william towers and william bowen of swansea and dan of had been selected . 
the match was played in swansea , and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd , with gate receipts of only recorded . 
the crowd hostility impacted on the players , and norman was nervous at the start of the match . 
, aged years and days , became the youngest welsh international player a record he held until the debut of tom in . 
despite the aimed primarily at , charlie arthur and george thomas , the welsh team produced an excellent effort , especially from the forwards . 
towers scored the first welsh try , which was converted by jim webb . 
the replied with a spirited run by , but he failed to break through the welsh defence . 
the tourists trailed even further after george thomas scored a try the half way line , which went some way to silence the from the crowd . 
webb , playing in out of position at full back , missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark . 
the continued to push , with elliot coming within CD yards of the try line , and when did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the yard line before he could touch down . 
in the second half wales continued to push their advantage when alexander the ball into the this was collected by sydney nicholls , who managed to get the ball across the try line , allowing jim to score . 
for the and for wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries , but there were no further scores in the game . 
the match was also of historical importance because of the welsh tactics employed . 
in the home nations championship wales had the CD CD quarter system , wherein the team would play with CD forwards rather than CD , and instead employ an extra centre CD quarter . 
the system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star welsh player arthur gould , whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team newport to retain the additional forward . 
with gould working in the west indies , wales again tried the CD CD quarter system against the , and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system . 
within CD years the other CD home countries had adopted CD CD quarter style of play . 
before they left wales , the played swansea and CD other local clubs , newport , and cardiff . 
they defeated swansea for their first win in wales , and followed this up with a victory over newport in front of , spectators . 
they finished their welsh matches , and the year , with a loss to cardiff in front of a partisan crowd . 
return to england 
the side entered having played matches for wins and CD draws . 
the play had improved throughout november and december following poorer form in their october matches positive press reports reflected this improvement . 
the team would go on to play a further matches before their february international against england . 
january started with a loss to bradford , during which police officers were required to keep many of the , spectators , many of them non paying , in order . 
this was followed by victories over leeds parish church , , rangers , and huddersfield . 
following further matches against , , and , where the team drew , lost , then won , the side faced yorkshire for a second time . 
yorkshire had been criticised in the press for fielding a weakened line up against the when the sides first met in december . 
after the unexpected loss , yorkshire were determined to make and a strong side was selected for the county , including fred , richard and john willie , all of whom would appear for england against the later that season . 
described as knocked about and stale , the struggled to compete against such strong opposition , and yorkshire scored CD converted tries before a try to left the scores at at half time . 
the second half was little better for the they conceded a further CD tries as well as a drop goal . 
the second of these tries was scored by after he ran the ball from his own half . 
scored a converted try late in the match , but this didn t prevent the suffering their largest defeat of the tour to the . 
later described the match as without a , the biggest beating we received in our whole tour . 
after a victory over valley district , the team travelled west to play , devonshire , taunton , and gloucestershire , and won all CD games . 
the victory over somerset was the new zealanders largest of the tour they scored CD tries in a victory . 
half back played outstandingly for the , while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition . 
devonshire and suffered heavy defeats by the new zealanders , before a strong gloucestershire side was dismissed . 
after defeating midland counties , the returned to london . 
the team had CD further matches before their international against england . 
the first was against CD of the strongest clubs in england , . 
andrew , who had toured new zealand and australia with the british isles side , played for the club in their defeat to the . 
the new zealanders won having scored CD tries , including CD by . 
their next opposition was a united services side mainly comprising royal navy players . 
the were again victorious , this time . 
the match against oxford university was postponed due to heavy , and so the team had a CD day break from playing their longest of the tour . 
england international 
the match against england was causing the players and management problems before it had even begun . 
the team manager , scott , was in dispute with the rfu over where the match should be played the rfu were adamant that the match should take place at ground , but scott wanted the game to proceed at the oval , where a larger crowd , and therefore higher gate receipts , could be secured . 
the strictly amateur rfu establishment were already suspicious of the profit making motives of the , and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue . 
the rfu was also in dispute with the other home over the formation of the international rugby football board . 
following a disputed try in an england scotland international match in , the scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game , but the rfu insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote , arguing that they deserved this as they were , they asserted , the senior body , and had the most member clubs . 
ireland , wales and scotland consequently refused to play against england until , when , following arbitration , the rfu relented and joined the . 
the absence of international matches was a factor in england agreeing to face the on february . 
the line ups selected for the february match were both strong , and close to full strength . 
though of the england side had not played internationally before , all were experienced at domestic level . 
the match was by rowland hill , who had also the first match in britain , against surrey . 
the opening of the first half was a scoreless affair , with much tackling and on the heavy ground . 
later in the half england scored CD tries through harry bedford , but both were disputed by the , who claimed that CD of their players had grounded the ball in goal . 
england took the CD try advantage into the second half . 
early in the second half a third disputed try was scored by the english . 
the try and its aftermath caused controversy and a rift between the and the rfu . 
attempted to tackle the english player , and in the process ripped his shorts off . 
the quickly formed a circle around to allow him to replace his clothing without being seen . 
while this was happening CD of the english players , frank , picked up the ball and scored a try . 
the new zealanders protested , believing that play had stopped after claiming had called dead ball but hill awarded the try , prompting CD of the native players , dick , williams , and , to leave the field in protest . 
the players were eventually persuaded to return , but not before hill had play . 
was very critical of hill , particularly because he was also secretary of the rfu . 
wrote after the tour that gross as these errors were , they were insignificant when compared with another that mr hill committed at the outset of the game , , at all in that game . 
the disputed try was followed by a final try for the english , who ultimately won . 
the rfu , at hill instigation , promptly demanded an apology from the captain of the day , edward , who had led the team as joe was injured . 
the english authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question , and that protesting a decision as the new zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike . 
the rfu threatened to bar any of their affiliated players in other words , the entire rugby playing population of england from facing the if they did not . 
swiftly sent an apology by telegram , but this was deemed inadequate he therefore sent another , CD days after the game the london establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the new zealanders approach to the game reports of rough and over aggressive play by the had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in britain . 
in the north of england , criticism of the visitors was rarer the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents , which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south . 
some of the , including joe , accused the rfu and the english press of hypocrisy , claiming that they were quick to the new zealanders for rough play , yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players . 
later matches and departure from england 
the remained in london following the england international . 
they defeated london welsh on february , before losing first to cambridge , then oxford university . 
from there they travelled north and won CD matches before losing to leigh . 
after a win over , there was a defeat to oldham , played on a ground said was so frozen it was dangerous . 
after reversing their previous loss to halifax with a win , the suffered a loss to barrow and district on march . 
the new zealanders then had a run of CD straight wins before a draw with hull . 
were then defeated for the second time in CD weeks in the tourists last match in northern england . 
the team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in britain . 
they eventually played southern counties , and beat them . 
this was their match in the british isles and their victory . 
the authorities and press in london continued to view the team negatively , and the boarded ship without a formal farewell . 
this perceived from the rfu provoked some criticism from the press outside london , as well as from the team manager scott , who felt that with the team official apology after the england match , the controversy should have put to rest . 
australia 
the majority of the left plymouth on march and pie followed a week later . 
they arrived in melbourne in may , where the team played mostly victorian rules football , hoping to make more money that way . 
although the side had employed jack to coach them in victorian rules during their tour of the british isles , the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training . 
as a result , the victorian rules matches were a failure the players with the rules , combined with the fact that most of the were rugby forwards and therefore less suited to the more open victorian rules , ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds . 
the side played CD victorian rules matches in total , including CD in new south wales , but won only CD of them , all against relatively weak opposition . 
the side success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in victorian rules the new zealanders played CD rugby matches while in victoria against melbourne , a navy selection , and victoria . 
the matches were all won , with their game against victoria a victory . 
after this they left for sydney for further rugby matches , and defeated new south wales . 
after CD further victories , the side again faced new south wales , and won the match . 
another CD victories followed , before the team played their only association football matches of the tour both defeats . 
the team travelled north to queensland , where , as in new south wales , rugby was the dominant code of football . 
consequently , the team exclusively played rugby while in the region . 
the faced queensland at the association ground in brisbane . 
the spectators witnessed the new zealanders overwhelm the to win the did not exert themselves in the win , and the score did not reflect their dominance . 
after a further CD matches , against and ipswich both of whom were comfortably defeated , the team returned to brisbane for a rematch with queensland . 
in contrast to their first meeting , the first half was a close affair , and the CD sides were tied at the conclusion of the half . 
billy suffered a kick to the head , and had to retire early in the second half . 
following the loss of , the play of the improved and they recovered to win . 
not long after the game concluded rumours circulated that some of the players had been offered by to throw the game . 
later said it was on the occasion of this match that CD of our players were thought , in racing , to be playing stiff , and that they had been got by some at all events , when accused of it at half time and cautioned , they played a different game in the second half . 
the response from the team management was to suspend CD players . 
the team travelled to , where they defeated the locals . 
the included a replacement player for only the second time , charles , after the reduced the playing strength of the side . 
the team then travelled back to new zealand , and arrived in on august . 
return to new zealand 
CD days after their return , the faced , who they defeated in front of a crowd of , . 
the side suffered further injury , to harry lee , and recruited w. for their match against district on august . 
despite playing the match CD players down , the comfortably defeated . 
following the side return to new zealand , the rugby football union demanded that the team management explain the accusations levelled at them in queensland . 
responded by insisting that the players had only been suspended while an investigation was conducted , and that the management was confident no wrongdoing had occurred . 
the northern rugby union since renamed queensland rugby union summarised the incident and aftermath in the queensland rugby union annual : it was apparent to a judge of the game that something was wrong with the , as they were not showing their usual dash and combination . 
CD members of the team were suspended , a charge being made against them of attempting the sell the match . 
the matter was bought before the union , who passed the following resolution that , having heard all available evidence regarding the charges against certain members of the native team , and having received an explicit denial of charges from the accused members and a satisfactory explanation from the management , we are of opinion that there are no facts before us the allegations ... 
it is unlikely , given the attitude of the rugby union to the before their departure , that they would have dismissed the allegations if evidence had existed . 
the side was back to full strength following the return of their suspended players when the side faced in . 
the their opponents CD tries to CD , and won . 
the side star player and half back , , stayed in when the team departed for . 
the side faced bay , who were touring , in , and defeated them . 
the play was praised by the press : the of the black passed with remarkable accuracy and between their legs , over their shoulders , under their arms and with their feet . 
the side then faced canterbury on august , who they . 
the report published in the press said of the performance the play showed on saturday afternoon was a fine exhibition of what several months of combination and practice will do . it must be admitted they were far and away too good for our local men . 
in the loose , in the , , passing , , or running they were very much indeed canterbury superior . 
such runs as were made by at full back , by madigan , , and w. , the passing of h. , f. , and all the backs as well as several forwards , the rushes of , maynard , , , and , and the and powers of nearly every CD , their opponents ... 
the side left and travelled north where they played in masterton . 
the match was won , and the next day they faced wellington , who they also defeated . 
the fixture against wellington was nearly abandoned because scott and the wellington rugby union could not agree on a venue the match went ahead only when the wellington officials agreed to cede the all profit from the match . 
after this the travelled to auckland where they played their last match , against the province on august . 
the match was lost after each team scored CD tries each , but the kicked a drop goal and a conversion . 
the loss ended a remarkable run of matches the had a game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over on march the side won , and drew CD match between the defeats . 
impact and legacy 
the tour had a significant impact on the development of rugby within new zealand . 
it was the first tour of the british isles by a team from the southern hemisphere , and the longest in the history of the sport . 
by the time the returned to new zealand , they had developed into a side superior to any in the country , and introduced a number of tactical innovations . 
CD of the players went on to play in new zealand , and CD , and david , subsequently captained new zealand . 
the tour also prompted the eventual formation of the new zealand rugby football union , later renamed new zealand rugby union in CD reason for its formation was to ensure greater control over any future touring new zealand sides . 
the sent an officially sanctioned new zealand team , captained by , to tour australia in . 
the are also the of the māori all blacks , a representative team organised by the , that first played in .

b 
b abbreviated b , and b , occasionally designated to distinguish it from the red dwarf b , also named , is an extrasolar planet approximately light years away from the sun in the constellation of . 
the planet orbits the solar twin star , a , approximately every CD days . 
discovered in june by geoffrey and r. paul butler , it was CD of the first hot jupiters to be discovered . 
it is also CD of the first non resolved planets to be detected directly . 
b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system . 
in july the international astronomical union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars . 
the process involved public nomination and voting for the new names . 
in december , the iau announced the winning name was for this planet . 
the winning name was submitted by the vega club of morocco and honours the century astronomer ibn al of muslim spain . 
discovery 
like the majority of known extrasolar planets , b was detected by the variations in its star radial velocity caused by the planet gravity . 
the variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the shift of spectrum . 
the planet existence was announced in january , together with b and the planet orbiting . 
like b , the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star , b orbits very close to its star , closer than mercury does to our sun . 
the planet takes . 
days to complete an orbit , with a axis of . 
au . 
a limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found . 
in the case of b , this lower limit is . 
of the mass of jupiter , though depending on the inclination of the orbit , the true mass may be much greater . 
however , astronomers found recently that inclination of the orbital plane is around and the true mass may be about . 
mj . 
is not to be assumed the mutual inclination between c and d is degrees . 
physical characteristics 
given the planet high mass , it is likely that b is a gas giant with no solid surface . 
the space telescope measured the planet temperature , and found that the difference between the CD sides of b of about , degrees , ranging from minus to degrees to about , to , degrees . 
the temperature difference has led to speculation that b is locked with the same side always facing a. 
had , on the assumption that the planet is similar to jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium , predicted b to have reflective clouds of and iron in its upper atmosphere . 
the cloud deck instead absorbs the sun radiation between that and the hot , high pressure gas surrounding the mantle , exists a of cooler gas . 
the outer shell of dark , , hot cloud is assumed to consist of and oxides planets , but other compounds like cannot be ruled out yet . 
the planet is unlikely to have large moons , since forces would either them from orbit or destroy them on short compared to the age of the system . 
the planet with b was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by . 
preliminary results from studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color , is . 
times as large and . 
times as massive as jupiter , meaning that the mean density is cm3 . 
it has a albedo of . 
in visible light . 
on its sun 
b appears to be responsible for increased activity on its parent star . 
observations suggest that there is a hot spot on the star around away from the sub planetary point . 
this may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star . 
the mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of variable stars , or the interaction between jupiter and its moon io . 
capel 
capel sometimes referred to as hen is a ruined chapel near in anglesey , north wales , dating back to the first half of the century . 
the chapel original purpose is unknown , but it might have been used as a memorial chapel or in connection with a local royal court , or as a chapel of ease in a large parish with a growing population . 
it was used for a time until the early century as a private place of worship for a nearby house , then later fell into disrepair . 
the walls still remain , with some traces of render on them internally , but there is no roof . 
it contains a century side chapel with a vault beneath , used as a burial chamber . 
it is a grade ii listed building , a national designation given to buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them , in particular because it is a substantially century structure with the unusual century vaulted south chapel . 
history and location 
the oldest parts of capel date from the first half of the century . 
this was a time when many churches on anglesey in north west wales were first built in stone following the end of viking raids and attempts by the to gain control of the island . 
the reason for its construction , and the saint to whom it was dedicated , are unknown . 
geraint jones , author of a guide to the churches of anglesey , suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel , or connected to a royal court nearby . 
and , authors of a guide to ancient anglesey monuments , note that it was built in the large parish of and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times . 
despite this , it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right . 
the chapel is sometimes referred to as hen hen being the welsh word for old and meaning chapel . 
the walls were partially rebuilt in the century , and the upper parts of the walls date from this time . 
a chapel was added to the south side of the building in the century . 
a vault under the south chapel was used to bury members of a local family , the pierce . 
in , the vault was used to record some atmospheres for the album you have just been by the by the , a collective of welsh musicians including members of echo and the , super animals and that was described by CD journalist as possibly the pop group of all time . 
for a time , capel was used as a private place of worship for house , a venerable mansion once owned by the lloyd family which came into the possession of william , baron boston , in the century . 
after the early part of the century , however , the chapel became unused and began to fall into disrepair . 
the walls remain to gable level , with some traces of render on the inside , but the roof has gone . 
capel is in the anglesey countryside near the parish church of st , is about . 
miles . 
km away . 
part of the churchyard wall remains , showing that it was originally within a mainly circular enclosure , as often found with early churches . 
it is cared for by cadw , the welsh assembly government body responsible for the built heritage of wales , and is open to the public . 
architecture and fittings 
capel is built from rubble masonry at about feet . 
m up the walls , the style changes and smaller stones are inserted into spaces between the larger blocks , showing where the century rebuilding started . 
the doorway is on the south side , headed by a plain arch , and dates from the century . 
there is a stone bellcote at the west end . 
there is no structural division between the nave where the congregation would have sat and the chancel where the altar would have been located . 
there are no window openings on the north side , but there is a blocked opening to the east about feet . 
m wide and there are the remains of a window on the south wall . 
there is a blocked window in the south wall of the south chapel . 
the vault , which is about square feet . 
m2 , is reached by stone steps from inside the south chapel . 
slabs form the roof of the vault and the floor of the chapel above . 
a stone in the nave , about square feet . 
m2 with a hole in the top , might once have been used as a churchyard cross . 
assessment 
capel has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a grade ii listed building the lowest of the CD grades of listing , designating buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them . 
it was given this status on september and has been listed because it is important as a substantially century structure , with some architectural details surviving from this early period , even though it is now in a ruinous condition . 
cadw which is responsible for the inclusion of welsh buildings on the statutory lists also notes the unusual century vaulted south chapel . 
the century antiquarian mentioned the church in her history of anglesey . 
she said that the architecture was of the kind , which bears testimony to its great antiquity . 
she recounted that a fox had once taken shelter in the ruins , and when it was dug out , the vault was discovered , containing several human skeletons , which into dust , when exposed to the air . 
she added that further exploration of the vault then revealed a large mass of human bones , several feet in depth . 
a book about abandoned churches in wales refers to the ancient monuments in this part of anglesey , and calls capel a medieval gesture of christian power in a land so obviously with the spirit of a pagan past . 
it notes that the wheel has turned full circle and capel today is just another ruined relic of a former age . 
the authors describe the chapel as a simple , square building with a small and austere south chapel , adding that the stone slabs over the vault are almost in imitation of the ancient burial chambers which dot the surrounding landscape .

as his acting career began to consume his schedule , continued his education through on set tutors . 
he admitted he was not very good at school , considering it useless and finding the work really difficult . 
he achieved a grades in the CD level exams that he took in , but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university . 
part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write , and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience . 
the , they love it , he told details magazine in . 
if there were any parties going on , they be tipped off as to where they were . 
career 
harry potter 
in , producer david asked to audition for the role of harry potter for the film adaptation of harry potter and the stone , the best selling book by british author j. k. . 
had been searching for an unknown british actor to the character , and the movie director chris columbus recalled thinking , this is what i want . 
this is harry potter , after he saw a video of the young actor in david copperfield . 
CD months later , and after several auditions , was selected to play the part . 
also endorsed the selection saying , i don t think chris columbus could have found a better harry . 
parents originally turned down the offer , as they had been told that it would involve CD films shot in los angeles . 
warner bros. instead offered a CD movie contract with shooting in the uk was unsure at the time if he would do any more than that . 
the release of harry potter and the stone released as harry potter and the stone in the united states took place in . 
received a CD figure salary for the lead role , but asserted that the fee was not that important to him his parents chose to invest the money for him . 
the film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews , and critics took notice of is the embodiment of every reader imagination . 
it is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions , from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing , wrote bob graham of the san francisco chronicle . 
a year later starred in harry potter and the chamber of , the second installment of the series . 
reviewers were positive about the lead actors performances but had opinions on the movie as a whole . 
the release harry potter and the of was the third film in the series . 
performance was panned by new york times journalist a. o. scott , who wrote that watson had to carry him with her performance . 
next was harry potter and the of fire in . 
the film was the second highest grossing harry potter film at that point , and singled out the humour as being a reason for the movie creative success . 
the future of the franchise was put into question when and his co leads emma watson and rupert hesitated signing on to continue their roles for the final CD episodes however , by march had signed for the final films , which put an end to weeks of press speculation that he would be denied the role due to his involvement in , in which he had performed nude on stage . 
reprised his role for the fourth time in harry potter and the order of the phoenix . 
stated that director david and actress made order of the phoenix the most fun film in the series to work on . 
his performance earned several award nominations , and he received the national movie award for best male performance . 
as his fame and the series continued , , , and watson left of their hands , feet , and in front of chinese theatre in hollywood . 
in july harry potter and the half blood prince was released , the series sixth instalment . 
received nominations for best male performance and global at the mtv movie awards . 
for financial and reasons the last book was divided into CD films , shot back to back , which drew criticism from the series fanbase . 
defended the split , stating that it would have been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film . 
he added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast paced with a lot of action , while the first part would be far more , focusing on character development he added that , had they combined them , those things would not have made it to the final cut . 
filming lasted for a year , concluding in june and on the last day of shooting , like most of the cast and crew , openly . 
the final film , harry potter and the part , was released in july . 
, along with the film , was critically acclaimed ann of the washington post asked , who could have predicted that , and watson would turn out to be good actors 
similarly , rex reed said , i m sorry to see go while rolling stone critic peter travers commented on well played , sir . 
roger gave the film a highly positive review , but felt that , and watson were upstaged by the supporting actors . 
admitted that some people would never be able to separate him from the character , but also said he is proud to be associated with this film series forever . 
despite positive feelings about the movies , he has no interest in doing more harry potter films . 
after hinted about writing an eighth book , was asked if he would do another film to which he replied it is very doubtful . 
i think years is a long time to spend with CD character . 
despite so much time to the series , has asserted that he did not miss out on a childhood like other child actors i ve been given a much better perspective on life by doing potter . 
made his film debut in the of panama , an american film based on john le spy novel , and a moderate commercial success . 
in he made his stage debut as a celebrity guest in a west end theatre production of the play what i , directed by kenneth branagh who also appeared with him in the second harry potter film . 
in he appeared in the film december boys , an australian family drama about CD orphans that was shot in and released to theatres in mid september . 
also in , co starred with carey in my boy jack , a television drama film shown on itv on remembrance day . 
the film received mostly positive reviews , with several critics praising performance as an year old who goes missing in action during a battle . 
stated , for many people my age , the first world war is just a topic in a history book . 
but i ve always been fascinated by the subject and think it as relevant today as it ever was . 
at age , in a bid to show people he was prepared for adult roles , he performed onstage in peter shaffer play , which had not been revived since its first run in , at the gielgud theatre . 
took on the lead role as alan , a stable boy who has an obsession with horses . 
advance sales topped . 
CD , and the role generated significant pre opening media interest , as appeared in a nude scene . 
opened on february and ran until june . 
performance received positive reviews as critics were impressed by the nuance and depth of his against type role . 
charles spencer of the daily telegraph wrote that he displays a dramatic power and an stage presence that marks a tremendous leap forward . 
he added i never thought i would find the but perfectly formed a sinister figure , but as alan : there are moments when he seems genuinely scary in his rage and confusion . 
the production then transferred to broadway in september , with still in the lead role . 
stated he was nervous about repeating the role on broadway because he considered american audiences more discerning than those in london . 
performance was nominated for a drama award . 
present 
after voicing a character in an episode of the animated television series the simpsons in late , debuted as j. 
finch in the broadway revival how to in business without really , a role previously held by broadway veterans robert and matthew . 
other cast members included john larroquette , rose and mary . 
both the actor and production received favourable reviews , with usa today commenting ultimately succeeds not by his fellow cast members , but by working in conscientious harmony with them and having a blast in the process . 
performance in the show earned him drama award , drama league award and outer critics circle award nominations . 
the production itself later received CD tony award nominations . 
left the show on january .

awards and nominations 
the boat race 
the boat race took place on march . 
held annually , the event is a side by side rowing race between crews from the universities of oxford and cambridge along the river thames . 
oxford won the race . 
oxford crew featured the oldest competitor in boat race history . 
the race took place in very difficult weather conditions strong winds and heavy rain resulting in the slowest winning time in over CD years . 
oxford won by CD lengths , the largest margin of victory since the race . 
oxford isis beat cambridge goldie in the reserve race , while oxford won the women boat race . 
background 
the boat race is a side by side rowing competition between the university of oxford sometimes referred to as the dark blues and the university of cambridge sometimes referred to as the light blues . 
first held in , the race takes place on the . 
mile . 
km championship course on the river thames in southwest london . 
the rivalry is a major point of honour between the CD universities and followed throughout the united kingdom and broadcast worldwide . 
cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having beaten oxford by over a length in the previous year race and the overall lead , with victories to oxford . 
the race was sponsored by for the fourth time . 
the first women boat race took place in , but did not become an annual fixture until the . 
until , the contest was conducted as part of the boat races , but as of the race , it is held on the river thames , on the same day as the men main and reserve races . 
the reserve race , contested between oxford isis boat and cambridge goldie boat has been held since . 
it usually takes place on the , prior to the main boat race . 
crews 
oxford crew weighed an average of pounds . 
kg more per rower than their opponents , and featured the oldest competitor in boat race history in year old american mike . 
cambridge crew consisted of CD britons , CD australians and an american , while oxford comprised CD americans , CD britons , an australian and a german . 
both , nick and rebecca , were former blues , while cambridge also saw year old tom edwards return , having rowed in . 
cambridge boat club president dan o was the seventh light blue president not to row in his own blue boat . 
race 
oxford were pre race favourites , but cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the surrey station . 
oxford took an early lead , but the boats closed on each other , and john garrett was forced to issue a number of warnings to both in an attempt to prevent a collision . 
by , oxford were nearly a length ahead and cambridge responded by the time the crews passed under bridge they were level . 
along oxford moved ahead once again , and were clear of cambridge after . 
oxford extended their lead to pass the finishing post in minutes seconds , CD lengths and seconds ahead of their opponents . 
driving rain , strong winds and water resulted in the slowest winning time for over CD years , but the largest margin of victory since the race . 
oxford isis beat cambridge goldie by CD and a quarter lengths in the reserve race . 
oxford won the running of the women boat race by half a length . 
reaction 
oxford oliver moore said we got the rage going in the crew , and we started to kill it , we hit an awesome rhythm . 
cambridge coach duncan holland his opponents well done to oxford , they were much faster on the day . 
following tradition , the victorious oxford crew tossed their into the thames . 
reaction 
the reaction often referred to as simply the is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of . 
the reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants , depending on the reagents and substrates employed . 
it was originally discovered by ivan in while studying the of vinyl . 
as originally described , the involves the activation of a using a stoichiometric lewis acid or acid promoter . 
the key step of the reaction mechanism involves a ring closure which forms the product see below . 
as the reaction has been developed , variants involving substrates other than and other than lewis acids have been subsumed under the name provided that they follow a similar pathway . 
the success of the as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and of as both motifs in natural products including , the , and a of and as useful synthetic for total synthesis . 
the reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published . 
the mechanism of the classical reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by to be an and is outlined below . 
of the by the acid catalyst generates a cation which undergoes a allowed as dictated by the woodward hoffman rules . 
this generates an cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a hydrogen . 
subsequent of the produces the product . 
as noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known what a in particular is the generation of the cation followed by ring closure to an cation . 
in order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be in the s trans s trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation . 
the of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate , with substituted substrates having an increased population of the due to strain . 
of an electron by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation . 
similarly , substitution directed inward the s trans conformation so severely that e z has been shown to occur in advance of on a wide range of substrates , yielding the trans regardless of initial configuration . 
in this way , the is a rare example of a reaction , whereas most are . 
the example below uses hydride to trap the cation so that no elimination occurs . 
see below along this same vein , vinyl of the type studied extensively by marcus of the university of hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of , a large amount of strain in the s . 
classical 
though following the general template above had been observed prior to involvement , it was his study of the of vinyl that marked the first major examination of this process . 
correctly reasoned that the in situ to form a before ring closure to the product . 
the reaction shown below involves an reaction to generate the . 
research involving the reaction was relatively quiet in subsequent years , until in the mid when several syntheses employing the were published . 
below are key steps in the syntheses of and nor , the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual that generates the . 
the classical version of the suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to . 
the first CD are not evident from the mechanism alone , but are indicative of the barriers to the last CD stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and of the intermediate . 
strong lewis or acids are typically required for the reaction e.g. 
, , . 
these are not compatible with sensitive functional groups , limiting the substrate scope . 
despite the possibility for catalysis , multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required in order to effect the reaction . 
this limits the atom economy of the reaction . 
the elimination step is not if multiple are available for elimination , various products are often observed as mixtures . 
this is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as separation is typically required . 
destroys a potential , decreasing the potential usefulness of the reaction . 
of the is sometimes not , meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of . 
modern variants 
the shortcomings noted above limit the usefulness of the reaction in its canonical form . 
however , modifications to the reaction focused on its issues continue to be an active area of academic research . 
in particular , the research has focused on a few key areas rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter , the reaction with more mild to improve functional group tolerance , directing the of the elimination step , and improving the overall . 
these have been successful to varying degrees . 
additionally , modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction , either by generating the cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the cation intercepted in various ways . 
furthermore , enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed . 
the sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field key examples are given below . 
directed 
the earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the took advantage of the silicon effect in order to direct the of the elimination step . 
this chemistry was developed most extensively by professor scott denmark of the university of illinois , in the mid and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron to promote the reaction . 
with products , the was selected for to varying degrees . 
the silicon directed reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product , shown below . 
the takes place before elimination of the alcohol , so that the resulting of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the anti to the . 
drawing on the effects compiled over various trials of the reaction , professor alison frontier of the university of rochester developed a paradigm for polarized in which electron and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction . 
creation of an effective vinyl and vinyl in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper and elimination . 
in addition , the electron withdrawing group increases the of the proton , allowing selective formation of the trans via . 
it is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a or withdrawing group alone , although the efficiency of the reaction yield , reaction time , etc . 
is typically lower . 
alternative cation generation 
by extension , any cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a . 
there have been a large number of examples published where the cation is arrived at by a variety of . 
CD such example involves the silver ring opening of . 
the silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of silver chloride . 
in the total synthesis of , of a vinyl likewise generates a cation via ring opening of the resultant . 
once the has occurred , an cation is formed . 
as discussed extensively above , the typical course for this intermediate is elimination followed by . 
however , these CD steps can be interrupted by various and , respectively . 
cation trapping has been developed extensively by g. west of the university of alberta and his review covers the field . 
the cation can be trapped with and carbon and can also undergo with various partners . 
below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a core in CD step with complete diastereoselectivity . 
trapping with various is less common . 
in CD study , the is paired with a michael reaction using an catalyst to initiate nucleophilic addition of the to . 
in this tandem reaction the catalyst is required for both it acts as the lewis acid in the and in the next step the group of first coordinates to in a ligand exchange with the oxygen atom before the actual michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the r group . 
variants 
the development of an enantioselective is a desirable addition to the repertoire of reactions . 
to that end , several variations have been developed utilizing and . 
are also known , in which extant direct the . 
almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of selecting CD direction for the vinyl groups to in turn sets the as shown below . 
directed can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way . 
in the example below , the group acts to direct the by preventing the distant from rotating towards it via unfavorable interaction . 
in this way the silicon acts as a auxiliary . 
the starting material is not but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the . 
substrates can exhibit axial to transfer if are used . 
the example below generates a in yield and enantiomeric excess . 
has additionally developed a camphor based auxiliary for that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of . 
the key step employs an unusual mixture of and as solvent . 
the first lewis acid promoted asymmetric was reported by aggarwal and utilized copper ii ligand complexes with up to ee . 
the enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased . 
related reactions 
of the are generally also subsumed under the same name . 
for example , an , can undergo a similar that is typically referred to as an reaction . 
other such extensions have been given similar names , including and . 
reaction 
because they the cation , electron often severely impede . 
building from this , several ring openings of have been reported . 
these are typically referred to as retro reactions . 
reaction 
of the reaction known as reactions have few instances there is CD example of a reported shown below , and several reactions in the literature . 
even these tend to suffer from poor , poor yields , or narrow scope . 
the difficulty stems from the relative over stabilization of the cation by electron donation , . 
j. c. w. 
john august , january , was the governor of kentucky and a united states senator from kentucky . 
he was the state first popularly elected senator following passage of the seventeenth amendment . 
from a prominent political family , was chosen as democrat william running mate in the gubernatorial election of despite the fact that he was not yet of legal age to serve as governor if called to do so . 
lost the election to republican william s. taylor , but the kentucky general assembly disputed the election results . 
during the political wrangling that followed , an unknown assassin shot . 
a day later the general assembly enough votes to give the election to , who was sworn into office on his deathbed . 
taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the democratic majority in the general assembly and a legal fight ensued between him and over the governorship . 
ultimately prevailed and taylor fled the state . 
following his term as governor , made a bid to become a u.s. 
senator . 
his stance in favor of prohibition cost him the votes of CD legislators in his own party and the seat went to republican william o. bradley . 
CD years later secured the seat by popular election , but he lost his re election bid largely because of his pro temperance views and his opposition to women suffrage . 
though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another CD decades , he never returned to elected office , failing in his gubernatorial bid in and his campaign in . 
he died in louisville on january , . 
early life 
j. c. w. was born at , near in nelson county , kentucky , son of william and julia . 
his maternal grandfather , charles a. 
, was governor of kentucky from to and served as general in the administration of john tyler . 
his uncle , robert c. , served as governor of louisiana . 
obtained his early education at academy in . 
in he served as a page in the kentucky house of representatives at the age of . 
later , he enrolled at central university now eastern kentucky university in richmond , kentucky but was forced to quit school at the age of to support his widowed mother . 
CD years later , he became principal of public schools , serving from to . 
, he studied law at the university of kentucky , where he earned his law degree in . 
he was admitted to the bar , and commenced practice in in . 
he also served as president of the young democrats club of nelson county . 
political career 
political career began in when he was elected without opposition to the kentucky house of representatives . 
he served CD consecutive terms and was speaker of the house in , his final year in the house . 
he also served as a delegate to every democratic national convention from to . 
governor of kentucky 
democrat william chose as his running mate in the kentucky gubernatorial election of . 
was hesitant about the selection because he wanted someone who could deliver the vote of his home county in the general election , and native nelson county was already committed to a rival candidate . 
but friends of assured him that would be loyal to reform agenda , whereas the CD other men was considering as running mates would stack the senate committees against him . 
was not yet , the minimum age to serve as governor , at the time of his selection . 
lost a close election to republican william s. taylor . 
when the general assembly session opened on january , , the election results were immediately challenged . 
with democrats in control of both houses of the assembly , the results seemed sure to be reversed . 
the assembly was still on january , , when was shot by an unknown assailant as he entered the state capitol building . 
the following day , as was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel , the general assembly enough votes to give him the election . 
he was sworn into office from his bed the same day . 
CD days later died , never having risen from the bed . 
legislative chaos ensued as taylor refused to acknowledge the assembly decision and the governorship . 
the republicans in the legislature taylor orders , while the democrats ignored taylor and followed the orders of their leadership . 
finally , on february , , taylor and agreed to let the courts settle the matter . 
the case first went before the louisville circuit court , which found in favor of . 
republicans appealed to the kentucky court of appeals , at that time the court of last resort in the state . 
on april , , the court of appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court . 
taylor appealed to the supreme court of the united states , which declined to hear the case on may , . 
taylor only supporter on the court was john marshall . 
following the supreme court ruling , taylor fled to indianapolis , indiana , fearing he would be implicated in assassination . 
became acting governor , but because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the election , a special election was held november , , to determine who would complete term . 
now of age won the election over republican john w. by fewer than , votes . 
shortly following the special election , married jean raphael of . 
the couple had CD sons . 
as governor sought to unite his party and the state . 
as part of this effort he supported changes to the partisan election law , authored by his late running mate while the latter was a member of the general assembly . 
he stressed non controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state educational system . 
he recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices , a reform both he and had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign . 
however , his passive leadership ensured that the general assembly did little to address his agenda . 
the only major pieces of legislation passed during term were a tax increase that added a half CD dollars to the state revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under to work without their parents consent . 
second term 
although the kentucky constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms , announced he would seek a full term as governor in . 
his candidacy was challenged in court , but the court ruled had not served a full first term and was eligible to run . 
due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non controversial reforms , he had no significant opposition in winning his party nomination . 
his record also deprived his republican opponent , morris b. 
, of any significant campaign issue in the general election . 
defeated and CD minor candidates . 
in his message to the legislature in , again raised the issue of a uniform school textbook law , which had not passed during his first term . 
the law was CD of few significant reforms that passed during the session . 
during the session funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late governor . 
in march , signed the day law racial segregation of all schools in kentucky . 
college , a private college in eastern kentucky that had been integrated since the , immediately filed suit to challenge the law . 
the substance of the law was upheld in the circuit court and the kentucky court of appeals . 
appealed to the supreme court , and in the court handed down an decision against the college . 
only john marshall . 
near the close of the session , legislators approved the creation of county from parts of carter , elliott , and lewis counties . 
olive hill was made the county seat . 
soon the county existence was challenged in court on grounds that it fell short of the square miles , km2 required by the state constitution and that it reduced the counties it was carved from to less than square miles , km2 . 
carter county joined the lawsuit , claiming the border of county passed too close to grayson , the seat of carter county , and , the seat of lewis county . 
the state constitution forbade county borders to pass within miles km of a county seat . 
on april , , the kentucky court of appeals found in favor of the and dissolved county . 
during the legislative session , urged investigation and prosecution of corrupt insurance companies , following the lead of new york attorney charles evans hughes . 
in particular , he recommended reducing the practice of deferred , which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on hand for illegal purposes . 
he further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in kentucky , the its economy and providing some protection against fraud . 
refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing black tobacco wars . 
he cited constitutional reasons for his refusal , but more probably his reasons were political the democrats were dominant in this region and he didn t want to challenge his own party . 
by collecting some old civil war debts from the federal government , virtually eliminated the state debt .

scientology in germany 
the church of scientology has been present in germany since . 
german authorities estimate that there are , active scientologists in germany today the church of scientology gives a membership figure of around , . 
the church of scientology has encountered particular from the german press and government and occupies a precarious legal , social and cultural position in germany . 
german courts have so far not resolved whether scientology should be accorded the legal status of a religious or community , and different courts have reached contradictory conclusions . 
the german domestic intelligence service has monitored the organization activities . 
the german government does not recognize scientology as a religion . 
it views it as an abusive business as a religion and believes that it pursues political goals that conflict with the values enshrined in the german constitution . 
this stance has been criticized , most notably by the u.s. government , which recognizes scientology as a religion and has raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect . 
scientologists in germany face specific political and economic restrictions . 
they are barred from membership in some major political parties , and businesses and other employers use so called sect to expose a prospective business partner or employee association with the organization . 
german federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning scientology in late , but abandoned the initiative a year later , finding insufficient legal grounds . 
despite this , polls suggest that most germans favor banning scientology altogether . 
background 
scientology , founded in the early in the united states by l. ron hubbard and today claiming to be represented in countries , has been a very controversial new religious movement . 
its stated aim is to clear the planet , to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations . 
scientology teaches that the source of people lies in , psychological acquired in the course of painful experiences , which can be cleared through a type of called made available by the church of scientology . 
the fact that scientologists have to pay large fees for and other scientology services has brought controversy to scientology throughout much of its history , with governments it as a profit making enterprise rather than as a religion . 
critics maintain that scientology is a business driven , , totalitarian ideology with world dominating aspirations , and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for scientology courses . 
scientology has fought lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion . 
these efforts have been partly successful scientology has gained recognition as a tax exempt religious group in a number of countries , most notably in australia in and the united states in , and in won an important case at the european court of human rights , which russia for failing to register scientology as a religion . 
the german government has said that it does not consider scientology a religion , but a commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism whose totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to germany democratic society . 
accordingly , the german government has taken a very strong stance against the organization . 
germany is not alone in opposing scientology in france , the church of scientology was convicted of organized fraud in october , after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for scientology products , and the church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether . 
scientology is similarly controversial in belgium , greece and the uk . 
on the subject of scientology status as a religion , the german government has pointed to a decision by the federal labor court of germany . 
that court , noting hubbard instruction that scientologists should make money , make more money make other people produce so as to make more money , came to the conclusion that scientology to be a church merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests . 
in the same decision , the court also found that scientology uses and totalitarian practices . 
given the lessons of germany century history , in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings , germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power . 
in scientology writings to the elimination of parasites and people who stand in the way of progress towards scientology world without , without criminals and without war evoke uncomfortable parallels with nazism , and have led to scientology being classified as an political movement . 
to further justify its stance , the german government has also pointed to the long history of u.s. court cases involving scientology , including the conviction of top scientologists in and for a conspiracy involving the infiltration of u.s. government agencies , and the theft of government documents , a u.s. supreme court finding that scientology practices took place in a environment , and scientology track record of pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators . 
in examining the potential threat posed by scientology the german government has noted that scientology organizations are structured so as to make the individual and financially dependent on a scientology system , and that members often abandon contact with friends and family . 
history 
scientology presence in germany 
scientology first became active in germany in . 
by , there were CD major centres scientology churches , as well as CD minor centres scientology in germany . 
the german scientology churches are located in the big cities munich , hamburg , berlin , düsseldorf , frankfurt am main , hanover and . 
of the scientology , CD are in baden , and CD in . 
following german re unification , scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former german democratic republic most adherents are found in baden , and north rhine . 
scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or in germany their umbrella organisation is the scientology germany domestic intelligence service , the für , or federal office for the protection of the constitution , estimates that there are , scientologists in germany , down from earlier estimates of , to , . 
the church of scientology reported around , members from the mid onwards this number remained stable for many years . 
however more recently scientology has said it has only , members . 
in scientology membership numbers arise because the church of scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures , essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses , regardless of their subsequent involvement . 
the number of bound scientology staff members working in german scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few CD . 
scientology formulated a germany strategy in similar to equivalent strategies pursued by scientology in other countries and regions of the world with the long term aim of transforming german society in line with the ideal a non society in which scientology enjoys influence . 
the programme sought to address scientology image problems in germany , to identify weak points in germany that could be exploited for political gain , such as germany national socialist history , and to increase both membership figures and political influence in german society , with a special emphasis on scientologists into key positions in industry and government . 
as most religions seek to widen their influence in society , such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort , much like those many religions engage in . 
however , according to the , the strategy has not had any significant success . 
by , government officials had been suspected of being scientologists and in cases the suspicions were confirmed , but apart from some isolated cases , most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise scientology . 
according to , it is unknown to what degree the germany programme is still being pursued . 
public opposition 
german public discourse does not regard scientology as a religion , but generally it as a cult or sect , or as an profit making venture preying on vulnerable minds . 
public concerns about the potential dangers posed by cults date back to the early , when widespread debate took place about youth religions such as the church , , children of god , and the divine light mission . 
the most prominent critics of these new religious movements were the sect commissioners of germany protestant churches , who also actively promoted the establishment of private initiatives of parents and concerned persons . 
educational information campaign became an important organization dedicated to opposing scientology taking an activist stance , it warned people not to get involved with scientology , filed successful lawsuits against the church of scientology over its in public places , and published an influential book , the of scientology and its front . 
in , the organization founder , , became the director of für und campaign for and freedom , germany most prominent anti cult organization . 
from sect experts about the influence of new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure on the government to deal with the situation as the movements were not doing anything illegal , the government resorted to issuing a range of leaflets and public statements giving general warnings about religious , the earliest of these publications appearing in . 
by events such as the siege in , the murders and suicides associated with the order of the solar temple , and the incidents in japan , german fears and concerns about new religious movements gained in intensity in the , with scientology attracting particular attention . 
that scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when robert young , an american ex scientologist and former pr official in the church of scientology , visited german officials in late and wrote an article in der , a widely read weekly magazine , describing scientology as a totalitarian system operating a the project force for members of scientology sea org found guilty of . 
from the mid onward , press articles , reports and essays on scientology appeared on an almost daily basis , accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience . 
as noted by the religious scholar hubert , scientology came to be seen as a serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will less zombies , but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state . 
this view of scientology as a public enemy , adds , became a matter of political senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against scientology , and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social . 
stephen a. kent , writing in , noted that officials at all levels of german government shared the insistence that scientology should be suppressed . 
scientology was viewed as a totalitarian , business driven organization NFP guilty of significant human rights abuses . 
officials examining primary and secondary sources , legal documents , and the testimony of former members , concluded that the organization was to a democratic state . 
federal and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of scientology . 
government publications on the dangers of increased between and , and a significant number of them dealt with the church of scientology . 
the german courts had approved such publications in , seeing them as part of the government responsibility to keep the public informed , and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom . 
in , the german parliament launched an commission to investigate and similar groups , in large part because of public concerns about scientology . 
its final report , published in june , concluded that scientology , alone among new religious movements , required monitoring by germany domestic intelligence services . 
an area of widespread concern in the german media has been the alleged infiltration of businesses by scientologists , in line with scientology declared aim to penetrate society , politics and business in preparation for world domination . 
attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium size companies , such as estate agents , management consultants and management training companies . 
management consultancy firms led by scientologists often conceal their association with scientology once they have recruited members of their clients upper management , these managers may send employees to scientology trainers , as part of company education and training programmes , without informing them as to the origin of the training methods used . 
an expensive commercial version of scientology oxford analysis , usually offered free as part of scientology in public places , temporarily entered some major german companies who were unaware of its via such a management consultancy firm . 
in the mid , german sect experts expressed concerns that scientologists were becoming active in the german after school market . 
these concerns arose because customers of around after school centres operated by scientologists in frankfurt , hamburg , and elsewhere might be unaware that their children were being taught by scientologists , using scientology methods . 
advertising the services would at most mention the name of l. ron hubbard , the founder of scientology , but not scientology itself . 
in early , thomas , commissioner of the german lutheran church in berlin and , and the historian knopp both likened the scientologist hollywood actor tom cruise to goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister . 
and knopp cited a leaked scientology video in which cruise was seen asking the audience whether scientologists should clean up the world , the audience responding with enthusiastic cheers cheers which and knopp felt were reminiscent of the audience response to goebbels famous question , do you want total war 
and knopp comments found few critics in germany . 
most germans consider scientology a organization . 
in , time reported that of germans favoured banning scientology a poll conducted in september by der found support for a ban . 
german scholars such as and gerald have commented that rhetoric dominates public discourse around scientology in germany in their view , efforts to frame information in such a way as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying . 
in words , this includes both the efforts of german politicians to enhance their popularity with strong statements and scientology efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution commenting on foreign reporting on scientology in germany , she adds that the american press may prefer news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to american stereotypes . 
both and assert that the situation is compounded by the general of scientific studies of scientology . 
as well as irving , professor of religious studies at the university of calgary in canada , have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by german scholars . 
attributes this situation to the strong influence of the christian churches in germany , which has made german academics wary of approaching the subject , because they fear repercussions for their research funding and for their prospects of future employment if they involve themselves in the debate . 
in a german public broadcaster , , showed the film until nothing remains , a account of the effect scientology had on CD german family . 
said to be based on a true story , the film attracted widespread media attention and a viewership of . 
CD . 
legal status 
while there have been calls for scientology to be banned , the church of scientology remains legal in germany and is allowed to operate there . 
its precise legal status however is unresolved . 
CD points are contested first , whether or not the teachings of scientology qualify as a religion or religion or these are equal before german law , and , whether or not these teachings are only used as a pretext for purely commercial activity if the latter were the case , this would most likely imply that scientology would not qualify for protection as a religious or community oder under article of the german constitution , which guarantees the freedom of belief , religion and . 
status as a religious or community also affects a broad range of other issues in germany , such as taxation and freedom of association . 
the federal court of justice of germany has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter , but implicitly assumed in that scientology represented a religious or community . 
the upper administrative court in hamburg explicitly asserted in that scientology should be viewed as a community . 
in , the federal labor court of germany decided that the church of scientology merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent a religious or community entitled to protection under article of the german constitution , although another decision by the same court left the question open again in . 
in another decision , the administrative court of baden in said there were no indications that the teachings of scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity . 
in , the federal administrative court of germany explicitly granted a scientologist protection under article . 
of the german constitution , which declares the freedom of religion and . 
many courts have declined to assess the religious status of scientology , finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand . 
the federal administrative court for example ruled in that the question whether or not scientology was a religion was irrelevant , and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities . 
the german government does not consider the church of scientology to be a religious or community and asserts that scientology is a profit making enterprise , rather than a religion . 
recent years have seen a number of court decisions in scientology favour , despite the very widespread negative attitude to scientology among politicians and the general public . 
government surveillance 
given the history of nazism rise to power in germany in the , the present german state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the german constitution . 
the domestic intelligence service für , or federal office for the protection of the constitution regards the aims of scientology as running counter to germany free and democratic order , and has been monitoring scientology since , as have the for the protection of the constitution in a number of german . 
minister for family policy instituted the surveillance , saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose scientology with all the means at her disposal . 
the german church of scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality of this surveillance in court . 
in december , the administrative court in berlin ruled against the berlin office for the protection of the constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and members of the church of scientology berlin as paid . 
the court ruled that the use of was . 
in , the same court ruled that it was illegal for the berlin office for the protection of the constitution to include the activities of scientology in its report , given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution . 
at the federal level , scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the in november . 
the federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of scientology , as outlined by l. ron hubbard in his writings , were incompatible with the german constitution . 
acting for the federal office for the protection of the constitution pointed out that hubbard had written that civil rights , for example , should be restricted to scientologists , and they asserted that the scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti scientology legislation . 
counsel acting for the church of scientology had contended that scientology was non political , its aims were the liberation of the human being , and that hubbard instructions were valid only within the church of scientology and were subject to interpretation , and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in germany . 
the court disagreed and ruled that many sources , some of them not accessible to the general public , indicated that the aims of the church of scientology did include the of the principle of equality and other essential human rights . 
in , surveillance was stopped by a court as inappropriate in , because there is no local branch of scientology and few members . 
as of may , the church of scientology in germany dropped the legal battle to prevent surveillance of its activities by the after the north rhine higher administrative court in refused to hear an appeal on the matter . 
being suspected of maintaining ambitions against the free , democratic basic order , the scientology organization added a declaration on human rights and democracy to its . 
there is at least CD example of surveillance of scientology by the german intelligence services outside of germany . 
in , the swiss government detained an agent of the german government , charging him with carrying out illegal business for a foreign state , working for a political information service and identity documents . 
the german government posted bail for the agent . 
he was eventually given a day suspended jail sentence for on scientology , and the german government apologized to switzerland for the incident . 
a sect filter , also known as a protective declaration , is a document that requires prospective business partners or employees to acknowledge any association with a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or employment contract . 
such sect , primarily used to screen out scientologists , have been drafted by german government agencies for use by businesses . 
commissioner offices exist in germany as part of regional or local government . 
a work instruction introduced in requires government staff in the local employment agencies and social security offices operated by the federal ministry of labour and social affairs to mark companies owned by scientologists with the letter s . 
where companies are suspected of having scientologist staff , prospective employees are alerted to this fact by government staff . 
government officials have publicised the names of individual scientologists and conducted media campaigns against their businesses some have placed advertisements in the press saying they are not scientologists in order to avoid the associated stigma . 
due to concerns about possible government infiltration by scientologists , applicants for civil service positions in are required to declare whether or not they are scientologists , and a similar policy has been instituted in . 
companies for government contracts were likewise required to state they are not scientologists in , this requirement was changed , and firms are now asked to sign a form stating that the technology of l. ron hubbard will not be used in executing the contract . 
when it became known that microsoft windows operating system included a disk developed by executive software international a company headed by a scientologist , this caused concern among german government officials and clergy over data security and the potential for espionage . 
to these concerns , microsoft germany agreed to provide a means to the utility . 
following letters of complaint about discrimination from scientology lawyers , some american companies such as general electric , ibm and ford motor company instructed their german to cease the use of protective declarations . 
the city state of hamburg set up a full time office dedicated to opposing scientology , the scientology task force for the hamburg interior authority , under the leadership of . 
in , in a case brought by a scientologist , the federal administrative court of germany ordered the city of hamburg to cease recommending the use of protective declarations to its business community , finding that the practice religious freedom . 
in june , the hamburg administrative court fined the city of hamburg , , for not with court instructions banning the use of sect . 
internet links to sample to be used by businesses had continued to remain available . 
barker , a professor of sociology at the london school of economics , has noted that germany has gone further than any other western european country in the civil rights of scientologists . 
the hamburg task force was closed down in august as a result of budget cuts moved to a position within the hamburg interior authority , where she continues her work on scientology . 
scientologists have been banned from joining major political parties in germany such as the christian democratic union , the christian social union of , the social democratic party of germany and the free democratic party . 
scientologist members of these parties have been purged , according to time magazine . 
scientologists have been prevented from running employment and au pair agencies in germany scientologists who were running such agencies had their permits revoked . 
in , a sports scientist and former member of the german national fencing team was dismissed from his job at the german olympic fencing centre after he stated in an interview that he had enjoyed reading books by l. ron hubbard and had participated in a course run by a scientologist management and communication consultancy firm . 
thomas , a german tv presenter , was falsely accused in of having taken part in scientology courses responded by announcing that he had not , and that he would cease all contact with a friend who had links to scientology . 
in , günther , the minister president of the german state of baden , expressed concern that scientologist john was to appear on programme , and asked the tv station to consider the invitation the said that would cause greater damage , and that scientology was not going to be discussed in the programme . 
in , the bavarian administrative court ruled that a woman working in a children centre , whose employment had been terminated when her ex husband identified her as a scientologist , should be reinstated . 
the woman had demonstrated to the court satisfaction that her beliefs were irrelevant to her work . 
according to the agreement that concluded the case , she promised not to use scientology methods in her work , and to inform the children parents of her membership in scientology . 
initiative to ban scientology 
in march , it was reported that german authorities were increasing their efforts to monitor scientology in response to the opening of a new scientology headquarters in berlin . 
on december , , german federal and state interior ministers expressed the opinion that the scientology organization was continuing to pursue anti constitutional goals , essential basic and human rights like the dignity of man or the right to equal treatment , and asked germany domestic intelligence agencies to collect and evaluate the information required for a possible judicial inquiry aimed at banning the organization . 
the move was criticized by german politicians from all sides of the political spectrum , with legal experts and intelligence agencies expressing concern that an attempt to ban the organization would likely fail in the courts . 
sabine weber , president of the church of scientology in berlin , called the accusations unrealistic and absurd and said that the german interior ministers evaluation was based on a few sentences out of , pages of literature . 
she added , i can also find hundreds of quotes in the bible that are totalitarian but that doesn t mean i will demand the ban of christianity . 
in november , the government abandoned its attempts to ban scientology , after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity . 
the report by the cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban scientology doubtful . 
first , the report stated there was no evidence that scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization there were german churches and missions , a german board , german , and no evidence that the organization was totally remote controlled from the united states . 
a foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a german one . 
the second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was scientology aggressive opposition to the constitution . 
here , the report found that scientology behaviour gave no grounds to assume that scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow germany free and democratic basic order . 
neither its nor any other utterances supported the conclusion that the organization had criminal aims . 
the also considered whether there were grounds to act against the church of scientology on the basis that they were medicine without a licence , but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning . 
commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt , , berlin interior minister , said , this organization pursues goals through its writings , its concept and its disrespect for minorities that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution . 
but they put very little of this into practice . 
the appraisal of the government at the moment is that scientology is a organization , but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to . 
the church of scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision , describing it as the only CD possible . 
of scientology activities by the german intelligence services continues . 
in february , the berlin administrative court ruled that a poster placed by local city authorities on an advertising column next to a bus stop in front of the berlin scientology headquarters , warning by of the potential dangers scientology activities posed to democracy and individual freedom , should be removed . 
the decision was upheld in july by the upper administrative court of berlin which ruled that the poster violated scientologists basic religious rights . 
criticism of germany stance 
the united states media , while generally reporting negatively on scientology in domestic news , has taken an at least partially supportive stance towards scientology in relation to germany . 
richard cohen for example , writing in the washington post , said in scientology might be CD weird religion , but the german reaction to it is still not to mention disturbing . 
alan cowell , writing in the new york times , wrote in that the german response to scientology motivated by officials fear that scientology was a totalitarian movement growing , like the nazi party , from beginnings was itself of the nazi era . 
the u.s. department of state has repeatedly claimed that germany actions constitute government and societal discrimination against minority religious groups and expressed its concerns over the violation of scientologists individual rights posed by sect . 
the u.s. department of state began to include the issue of scientology in germany in its annual human rights reports after the agreement between the church of scientology and the u.s. internal revenue service , through which scientology gained the status of a tax exempt religion in the united states . 
that decision also marked the beginning of more intense lobbying efforts by the church of scientology in washington , using paid . 
the state department human rights report on germany , released in january , warned that artists and businesses with scientology connections may face boycotts and discrimination , sometimes with government approval . 
past targets of such actions had included scientologist actors tom cruise and john , as well as jazz pianist chick . 
also in january , an open letter to then chancellor appeared , published as a newspaper advertisement in the international herald tribune , drawing parallels between the organized oppression of scientologists in germany and nazi policies by germany in the . 
the letter was conceived and paid for by hollywood lawyer fields , whose clients have included tom cruise and john , and was signed by prominent figures in the u.s. entertainment industry , including the top executives of mgm , warner bros. , paramount , universal and sony pictures entertainment as well as actors dustin hoffman and goldie , director oliver stone , writers mario and vidal and talk show host larry king . 
it echoed similar parallels drawn by the church of scientology itself , which until then had received notice , and was followed by lobbying efforts of scientology celebrities in washington . 
u.s. department of state spokesman nicholas burns rejected the nazi comparisons in the open letter as and distanced the u.s. government from nazi comparisons made by the church of scientology , saying , we have criticized the germans on this , but we aren t going to support the scientologists terror tactics against the german government . 
chancellor , commenting on the letter , said that those who signed it don t know a thing about germany and don t want to know . 
german officials argued that the whole fuss was up by the scientologists to achieve what we won t give them tax exempt status as a religion . 
this is , pure and simple . 
officials explained that precisely because of germany nazi past , germany took a determined stance against all radical cults and , including right wing nazi groups , and not just against scientology . 
christian democratic union party denounced the letter as absurd and cited german court stating that scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a of oppression . 
in february , a united states immigration court judge granted to a german scientologist who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in her homeland . 
in april , john met personally with u.s. president bill clinton at a conference in philadelphia . 
later said clinton assured him that he would really love to help with the issue over in germany with scientology . 
according to , clinton recalled that he had a roommate years ago who was a scientologist and had really liked him , and respected his views on it , stating that scientologists were given an unfair hand in germany and that he wanted to fix it . 
in september , john , chick and fellow scientologist isaac hayes were heard by the commission on security and cooperation in europe , also known as the helsinki commission , voicing their complaints about the treatment of scientologists in germany , and had a briefing with united states national security sandy berger , whom clinton had assigned to be the administration scientology point person . 
the german ambassador responded with a letter to the stating that the german government had come to the conclusion that scientology pseudo scientific courses can seriously jeopardize individuals mental and physical health and that it exploits its members , adding that membership can lead to psychological and physical dependency , to financial ruin , and even to suicide . 
in addition , there are indications that scientology poses a threat to germany basic political principles . 
a united nations report in april raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect . 
however , it rejected the comparison of the treatment of scientologists with that of jews during the nazi era . 
in , the german stern magazine published the results of its investigation of the case . 
it asserted that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part of her application ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a scientologist had in fact been written by fellow scientologists at her request and that of scientology office of special affairs , and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax at the time she applied for . 
on a visit to clearwater , florida , of the scientology task force for the hamburg interior authority likewise alleged that the case had been part of an orchestrated effort by scientology undertaken for political gain , and a spectacular abuse of the u.s. system . 
german expatriate scientologists resident in clearwater , in turn , accused of a hate campaign in germany that had ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of scientologists and maintained that scientologists had not exaggerated their plight for political gain in the united states . 
mark , a former top church of scientology official , said that although scientology had not orchestrated the case , there would have been nothing improper if it had . 
in , joachim , writing in the swiss zeitung , noted that , a german christian theologian , director of the hannah institute for research into in dresden and recipient of an honorary doctorate from lund university , sweden , for his of religious freedom , had been pressured to publication of his scientific study of scientology after having found himself the subject of widespread criticism in the german media for advocating a more tolerant attitude towards scientology . 
concluded that had triumphed over science and noted an apparent lack of confidence in germany ability to engage in open public discourse on the matter . 
the u.s. department of state report on religious freedom in germany , published in , stated that the status of the church of scientology remains in . 
the constitutional court and various courts at the state level have not explicitly ruled that scientology is a religion . 
government agencies at the federal and state level have rules and procedures that discriminate against scientology as a group and against its members . 
CD of the major political parties the christian democratic union , christian social union , social democratic party , and free democratic party ban scientologists from party membership . 
NFP scientologists reported instances of governmental discrimination . 
although courts at the state and federal level condemned the improper use of so called sect to and boycott scientologists , they remained in use in the public sector . 
typically asked potential new employees to confirm in writing that they had no contact with scientology , did not participate in its training courses , and rejected its doctrines . 
NFP catholic and protestant churches continued to oppose scientology sic , although press reporting and public reactions to scientology decreased . 
several private organizations issued warnings about after school study programs run by scientologists .

battle of sullivan island 
the battle of sullivan island or the battle of fort sullivan was fought on june , , during the american revolutionary war . 
it took place near charleston , south carolina , during the first british attempt to capture the city from american rebels . 
it is also sometimes referred to as the first siege of charleston , owing to a more successful british siege in . 
the british organized an expedition in early for operations in the rebellious southern colonies of north america . 
by logistical concerns and bad weather , the expedition reached the coast of north carolina in may . 
finding conditions unsuitable for their operations , general henry clinton and admiral sir peter parker decided instead to act against charleston . 
arriving there in early june , troops were landed on long island , near sullivan island where colonel william commanded a partially constructed fort , in preparation for a naval bombardment and land assault . 
general charles lee , commanding the southern continental theater of the war , would provide supervision . 
the land assault was frustrated when the channel between the CD islands was found to be too deep to , and the american defenses prevented an amphibious landing . 
the naval bombardment had little effect due to the sandy soil and the nature of the fort log construction . 
fire by the defenders wrought significant damage on the british fleet , which withdrew after an entire day bombardment . 
the british withdrew their expedition force to new york , and did not return to south carolina until . 
background 
when the american revolutionary war broke out in , the city of charleston in the colony of south carolina was a center of commerce in southern north america . 
the city citizens joined other colonists in opposing the british parliament attempts to tax them , and militia recruitment increased when word arrived of the april battles of lexington and concord . 
throughout and into , militia recruits arrived in the city from the colony , the city manufacturers and tradesmen began producing war materiel , and defensive fortifications began to take shape around the city . 
british operations 
british army forces in north america were primarily tied up with the siege of boston in . 
bases of operations where they had more control , the british planned an expedition to the southern colonies . 
major general henry clinton , then in boston , was to travel to cape fear , north carolina , where he would join with largely scottish raised in the north carolina , and a force of , men from ireland under the command of major general charles cornwallis . 
the plan was beset by difficulties from the start . 
the irish expedition , originally supposed to depart at the beginning of december , was delayed by logistical difficulties , and its , troops did not depart until february , , escorted by warships under the command of admiral sir peter parker . 
clinton left boston on january with CD companies of light infantry , and first stopped at new york city to confer with william tryon , new york royal governor . 
major general charles lee , sent by major general george washington to see to the defense of new york , arrived there the same day as clinton . 
new york was at that time extremely tense forces were beginning to and evict , and the british fleet anchored there was having difficulty acquiring provisions . 
despite this , clinton made no secret that his final target was in the south . 
lee observed that this was certainly a way of proceeding to communicate his full plan to the enemy is too novel to be credited . 
this was not even the first notice of the expedition to the colonists a letter intercepted in december had already provided intelligence that the british were planning to go to the south . 
clinton arrived at cape fear on march , expecting to find the european convoy already there . 
he met with the royal governors of north and south carolina , josiah martin and william campbell , and learned that the recruited scottish had been defeated at moore creek bridge CD weeks earlier . 
clinton also received pleas for assistance from the royal governor of georgia , james wright , who had been arrested , and then escaped to a navy ship . 
parker fleet had an extremely difficult crossing . 
by storms and high seas , the first ships of the fleet did not arrive at cape fear until april , and cornwallis did not arrive until may . 
after several weeks there , in which the british troops raided properties , clinton , cornwallis and parker concluded that cape fear was not a suitable base for further operations . 
parker had sent out some ships on expeditions up and down the coast , and reports on the partially finished condition of the charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there . 
american defenses 
john , recently elected president of the general assembly that remained as the backbone of south carolina revolutionary government , organized a defense force under the command of year old colonel william , a former and indian fighter . 
these forces comprised CD infantry regiments , CD rifle regiments , and a small artillery regiment they were augmented by CD independent artillery companies , and the total force numbered about , . 
these forces were further augmented by the arrival of continental regiments from north carolina and virginia , troops , as well as militia numbering , from charleston and the surrounding . 
saw sullivan island , a sandy of land at the entrance to charleston harbor extending north about miles . 
km long and a few CD yards wide , as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from enemy warships . 
a large vessel sailing into charleston first had to cross charleston bar , a series of submerged lying about miles km southeast of the city , and then pass by the southern end of sullivan island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor . 
later it would also have to pass the northern end of james island , where fort johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city . 
and his south carolina regiment arrived on sullivan island in march , and began construction of a fortress to defend the island and the channel into charleston harbor . 
the construction moved slowly captain peter of the naval detachment described the site as an immense pen feet long , and feet wide , filled with sand to stop the shot . 
the gun platforms were made of CD inches thick and with wooden spikes . 
congress had appointed general lee to command the continental army troops in the southern colonies , and his movements by land shadowed those of clinton fleet as it sailed south . 
lee wrote from wilmington on june that the fleet had sailed , but that he did not know whether it was sailing for virginia or south carolina . 
he headed for charleston , saying i confess i know not whether i shall go to or from the enemy . 
he arrived in charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the harbor , and took command of the city defenses . 
he immediately ran into a problem the south carolina troops militia or the colonial regiments were not on the continental line , and thus not formally under his authority . 
some south carolina troops resisted his instructions , and had to intervene by proclaiming lee in command of all south carolina forces . 
square shaped fort sullivan consisted only of the completed seaward wall , with walls made from logs feet . 
m high and feet . 
m wide . 
the walls were filled with sand , and rose feet . 
m above the wooden platforms on which the artillery were mounted . 
a hastily erected palisade of thick helped guard the powder magazine and unfinished northern walls . 
an assortment of cannon , ranging from and pounders to a few british pounders and french pounders , dotted the front and rear walls . 
general lee , when he had seen its unfinished state , had recommended abandoning the fort , calling it a slaughter pen . 
president refused , and specifically ordered colonel to obey lee in everything , except in leaving fort sullivan . 
delaying tactics so angered lee that he decided on june that he would replace the battle began the next day before he could do so . 
lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to point . 
british arrival 
the british fleet weighed anchor at cape fear on may , and arrived outside charleston harbor the next day . 
noticed a british scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby long island now known as the isle of , just a few CD yards from sullivan island troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of sullivan . 
by june , most of the british fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in CD hole , an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance . 
with the fort on sullivan island only half complete , admiral parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls . 
believing he would not even need clinton land forces , he wrote to clinton that after the fort guns were knocked out , he would land and marines which i have practiced for the purpose under the guns and that they could keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper . 
the british fleet was composed of CD man of war ships the flagship gun bristol , as well as the gun experiment and frigates , active , , , , friendship and the bomb vessel thunder , in total mounting nearly cannon . 
the army forces in the expedition consisted of the , , , , , and regiments of foot , and part of the . 
on june , clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms . 
however , the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it which was flying a truce flag , and it was not delivered until the next day . 
that same day , clinton began landing , troops on long island . 
the intent was that these troops would across the channel now known as inlet between long and sullivan , which the british believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so , while the fleet bombarded fort sullivan . 
general lee responded to the british landing with several actions . 
he began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the british were intending to launch an attack directly on charleston . 
he also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an of retreat for the fort garrison , but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly CD mile . 
km channel separating the island from charleston the unwillingness of and to support the effort may also have played a role . 
the americans also constructed an at the northern end of sullivan island , which was manned by more than men and CD small cannons , and began to a guard post at point on the mainland opposite fort sullivan . 
general clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on june . 
an attempt to the channel between the CD islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder deep , too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition . 
he considered using boats to ferry the troops across , but the americans , with timely advice from general lee , adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the long island position . 
as a result , the british and american forces faced each other across the channel , engaging in occasional and largely cannon fire at long range . 
clinton reported that this meant that admiral parker would have the glory of being defeated alone . 
the attack was originally planned for june , but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted parker to call it off for several days . 
battle 
on the morning of june , fort sullivan was defended by colonel , commanding the south carolina regiment and a company of the south carolina artillery , numbering men . 
at around am that morning , a british ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready for the attack . 
less than an hour later , CD warships had sailed into positions facing the fort . 
thunder and friendship anchored about . 
miles . 
km from the fort while parker took active , bristol , experiment and to a closer position about yards m from sullivan island , where they anchored facing broadside to the fort . 
each of these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reached its position , and the defenders returned the fire . 
although many of thunder shots landed in or near the fort , they had little effect according to , we had a in the middle , that swallowed them up instantly , and those that fell in the sand in and about the fort , were immediately buried . 
thunder role in the action was also relatively short lived she had anchored too far away from the fort , and the of her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their mounts . 
owing to shortage of gunpowder , men were deliberate in the pace of their gunfire , and only a few officers actually aimed the cannons . 
they also fired in small , CD cannon at a time . 
CD british observer wrote , their fire was surprisingly well served and it was slow , but decisive indeed they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed . 
general clinton began movements to cross over to the northern end of sullivan island . 
by CD of war , the flotilla of carrying his troops came under fire from colonel william thomson defenses . 
facing a withering barrage of grape shot and rifle fire , clinton abandoned the attempt . 
around noon the frigates , , and were sent on a roundabout route , avoiding some , to take a position from which they could enfilade the fort main firing platform and also cover CD of the main escape routes from the fort . 
however , all CD ships grounded on an , and the of and became entangled in the process . 
the british managed to and , but remained grounded , having moved too far onto the submerged . 
consequently , none of these ships reached its intended position , a piece of good fortune not lost on colonel had these CD ships effected their purpose , they would have us in such a manner , as to have driven us from our guns . 
at the fort , ordered his men to concentrate their fire on the CD large man of war ships , bristol and experiment , which took hit after hit from the fort guns . 
chain shot fired at bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the and . 
CD round hit her quarterdeck , slightly wounding parker in the knee and thigh . 
the shot also tore off part of his , leaving his exposed . 
by mid afternoon , the defenders were running out of gunpowder , and their fire was briefly suspended . 
however , lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland , and the defenders resumed firing at the british ships lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day , telling colonel , i see you are doing very well here , you have no occasion for me , i will go up to the town again . 
admiral parker eventually sought to destroy the fort walls with persistent broadside . 
this strategy failed due to the nature of the wood used in its constructions the structure would , and it absorbed the rather than . 
the exchange continued until around pm , when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities , and the fleet finally withdrew out of range . 
at CD point during the battle , the flag had designed and raised over the fort was shot down . 
sergeant william jasper reportedly ran to the and raised the flag again , holding it up and the troops until a flag stand could be provided . 
he was credited by with reviving the troops spirits , and later given for bravery . 
a painting of this event pictured above depicts jasper actions . 
casualties , parker reported sailors killed and wounded aboard bristol , which was hit more than times with much damage to the hull , yards , and rigging . 
experiment was also badly damaged with sailors killed and wounded . 
active and reported casualties each . 
the americans reported their casualties at only killed and wounded . 
the following morning , the british , unable to drag the grounded off the , set fire to the ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands . 
in small boats sailed out to the burning ship , fired some of its cannons at the british ships , took what stores and they could , and retreated shortly before the ship powder magazine exploded . 
aftermath 
the british did not attempt to take the fort again . 
within days of the battle , learned of the signing of the declaration of independence in philadelphia . 
the british troops were on their transports , and on july the british fleet withdrew northward to help the main british army in its campaign against new york city . 
to add insult to injury , CD of the british transports grounded off long island and was captured by forces . 
the british did not return to charleston until , when general clinton successfully besieged the city and captured an entire army . 
until the south again became a focus of the war in late , its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort . 
admiral parker and general clinton engaged in a war of words after the battle , each seeking to cast the blame on the other for the expedition failures . 
although clinton was not blamed by the government , popular opinion held him responsible , and parker was lauded for his personal bravery . 
legacy 
fort sullivan was renamed fort shortly after the battle to honor colonel william for his successful defense of the fort and the city of charleston . 
modified in the years after the battle , it was by fort as the principal defense of charleston prior to the outbreak of the american civil war . 
in , to celebrate the centennial , companies from savannah , augusta , , columbia , new york and boston were invited to charleston . 
the site was turned over to the national park service in , and is now part of fort national monument . 
a small monument to the battle of sullivan island has been placed at the northeastern tip of the island , overlooking the inlet where general clinton soldiers had hoped to cross . 
the monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement . 
CD iconic emblem of the battle was the flag designed by colonel . 
commissioned by the colonial government , he designed a blue flag with a white crescent in the top left corner , which was flown at the fort during the battle . 
despite being shot down during the siege , it was seen as a symbol of this successful defense and famously raised during victory . 
it came to be known as the flag or liberty flag . 
when charleston lost to the british in the siege was reclaimed by american forces at the end of the war , the flag was returned to the city by general greene .

route description 
mercer county 
route begins at a modified cloverleaf interchange with interstate and interstate in hamilton township , and it serves as the western continuation of interstate , heading to the northwest as a CD lane freeway . 
the route interchanges with route , a spur of route which connects to u.s. route , at a partial interchange with a northbound exit and southbound entrance . 
route to CD lanes past this interchange and crosses into . 
the route comes to a southbound exit and entrance for road . 
at this point , route becomes the delaware river scenic byway , a state scenic that was also designated a national scenic byway in . 
route runs along the bank of the delaware river and enters a truck restricted tunnel that passes by historic houses and cemetery . 
within this tunnel , route features a southbound exit and northbound entrance for lalor street . 
the route emerges from the tunnel as the john fitch parkway , passes by arm park , and comes to a traffic light at thunder road cass street where it back to CD lanes . 
route meets south warren street at another traffic light . 
the median and it passes under the railroad bridge , which carries the amtrak northeast corridor over the delaware river . 
route passes under the bridge , which carries u.s. route over the delaware river . 
to u.s. route southbound is provided by ramps from route while access to route from northbound u.s. route is provided by south warren street . 
route passes under the lower bridge and the median again . 
it interchanges with market street , which provides access to route , and then features an interchange which provides access to the new jersey state house with a northbound exit and southbound entrance . 
route crosses the creek and features an interchange which provides access to south warren street with exits in both directions but only a northbound entrance . 
route continues to a cloverleaf interchange with street county route , which provides access to the street bridge over the delaware river . 
riverside avenue exits as a frontage road the northbound lanes of route before the road features a northbound exit for avenue . 
route comes to a partial interchange with avenue , with a northbound exit and southbound entrance , and then features a northbound exit for south avenue . 
the freeway portion of route ends at the intersection with lee avenue and it continues northwest along the delaware river as a CD lane divided highway . 
the route meets the southern terminus of county route sullivan way . 
the median again and then as the route meets the southern terminus of route , a former alignment of route that currently serves as a frontage road . 
route crosses into ewing township and becomes the daniel bray highway . 
it passes under the west railroad bridge , which carries and s west line over the delaware river . 
route intersects route again and then comes to a complex interchange with interstate , with the ramps within the median of route , just to the east of the falls bridge . 
upon crossing the delaware and canal , route down to a CD lane undivided road called river road . 
it continues along the delaware river , next to the delaware and canal , which runs between route and the river . 
the route intersects the northern terminus of route . 
farther north , route enters township and continues into a more rural setting with trees . 
route heads to washington crossing state park , where it intersects county route , which heads east on washington crossing road , and the approach to the washington crossing bridge , which continues into pennsylvania as pennsylvania route . 
route continues north along the delaware river through , passing by washington crossing state park . 
county 
route crosses into west township in county . 
it enters , where route becomes a CD lane divided highway . 
at the intersection of south main street , route becomes concurrent with route . 
the route becomes an undivided highway again and meets the western terminus of county route brunswick street . 
it meets route bridge street , where route ends and route turns west for a CD block wrong way concurrency with the CD lane , undivided route , lasting to the intersection of main street , where route turns north on main street . 
route follows main street north through , crossing into delaware township .

route makes a sharp left turn and heads west along the river as a rural road , crossing into township , where the name of the road changes from main street to daniel bray highway . 
here , it intersects with county route road . 
the route to the north and continues along the delaware river for several miles , crossing into frenchtown , where the route becomes road . 
upon entering frenchtown , an end shield for northbound route is posted to mark the end of state maintenance , which officially ends at the washington street intersection , where maintenance is transferred to the county . 
despite this , route officially continues farther north along road to its northern terminus at route bridge street race street , a short distance east of route s western terminus at the frenchtown bridge . 
the southern terminus of county route is located a block north of the northern terminus of route along route . 
history 
the current route was originally legislated in as part of the delaware river drive , a named state highway that was proposed to run from along the delaware river from to the new york border in township . 
route was originally defined in to run from to newark . 
the original route ran from downtown along state street and drive . 
from there , it followed its current alignment to , where it followed present day route to to present day county route , which it followed to woods tavern . 
the route turned north on u.s. route also designated route and followed that route to , where it followed u.s. route to newark . 
the current alignment of route from to route in frenchtown was designated route in . 
the alignment of route between and was eventually shifted to follow present day u.s. route , which was also route now route between and flemington and route between flemington and . 
in , route was planned as an extension of route from frenchtown to route now route in alpha . 
while this road was never built , much of the alignment north of milford is served by county route . 
in , a spur route , route , was created , running along u.s. route bridge street in to the new hope bridge . 
in the new jersey state highway renumbering , route was to continue north from to frenchtown on route , and the route designation between and newark was removed in favor of u.s. route between and and u.s. route between and newark . 
the section of former route between route and route became route . 
plans for a limited access route along the route corridor go back to , when a parkway was proposed along the delaware river between and this proposal never materialized . 
plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early to construct a road , the john fitch parkway , that was to run from hamilton township to interstate in ewing township . 
this road was built between and from south warren street in to present day interstate in ewing township . 
construction of this portion john fitch parkway took up much of s available waterfront along the delaware river . 
the former alignment of route in the northern part of and in ewing township became route . 
between and , the route freeway was built between the interstate interstate interchange and route in hamilton township . 
a CD lane street , road , connected the CD freeway sections . 
plans were then made to fill the gap between the CD freeway sections in . 
construction began in on the route freeway between route and the railroad bridge . 
the road was to include CD traffic lights at cass street and south warren street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the delaware river . 
the tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by but was delayed after the army corps of engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel . 
the roof was put in place in october and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on march , . 
a restriction to trucks over tons was put in place and made permanent in november . 
by the , the state gave the part of route south main street between route and route in to the city , and route was rerouted to use all of route and CD block of route . 
prior to this , south main street had been turned CD way southbound . 
route , which is only signed on overhead street signs , still exists , though it is fully concurrent with route . 
major intersections 
tropical storm 
tropical storm was the tenth tropical storm of the atlantic hurricane season . 
developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the african coast on august . 
the wave quickly became organized and was declared tropical depression CD while located mi km to the south southeast of the cape verde islands on september . 
the depression was quickly upgraded to tropical storm around noon the same day . 
over the next several days , moved in a general west northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on september . 
strong wind shear , some due to the outflow of hurricane ike , and dry air caused the storm to weaken . 
on september , the combination of wind shear , dry air , and cooling waters caused to weaken into a tropical depression . 
deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm . 
the low ultimately dissipated while located mi km east of on september . 
however , the remnant moisture led to minor flooding on the island of st. croix . 
meteorological history 
tropical storm formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of africa near the end of august . 
it tracked south of cape verde and slowly developed , and on september the disturbance became tropical depression CD while located south southeast of the cape verde islands . 
as the depression became more organized , an eye like feature developed in the upper levels of the system . 
the depression was upgraded to tropical storm CD hours after forming . 
was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly . 
continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical . 
however , due to the location of the storm , there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings , and the national hurricane center was uncertain of its actual intensity . 
despite the lack of wind shear around the storm , the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification . 
the storm was also heading into an area where shear was to significantly increase due to an upper level trough diving southward . 
despite convection being partially removed from the center of , the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on september as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized . 
the intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening , causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger . 
reached its peak intensity of mph km h around a.m. as it continued to become more organized . 
however , there were indications that it had already begun to weaken . 
towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm , a sign that dry air was entering the system . 
during the afternoon hours , the structure of began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll . 
by the late night , the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center . 
despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear , a large , deep burst of convection formed in the northern of . 
the center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity . 
the forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as continued westward and no change in intensity over the day forecast was predicted . 
however , the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and weakened again . 
by the afternoon , the center of was only a of clouds , devoid of convection . 
during the overnight hours on september into the morning of september , convection associated with began to somewhat , mostly to the north of the circulation , due to the strong wind shear . 
by mid morning , re intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection . 
however , the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on by late morning . 
the convection around the system became from the center and weakened slightly . 
the weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong shear . 
became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid afternoon and the storm weakened to mph km h , barely holding on to tropical storm status . 
regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours , but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm . 
due to the lack of convection , was downgraded to a tropical depression at with winds of mph km h . 
since there was no convection around the system , it would have normally been classified a remnant low but , due to the possibility of the storm over the next several days , it was considered a tropical depression . 
the next morning , was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm . 
no redevelopment was expected with as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated . 
however , the remnant low associated with began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on september . 
around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed . 
on september , wind shear took over the system again . 
around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . 
the national hurricane center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed . 
finally , on september , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of deteriorating into an open wave . 
however , on september , the remnants of redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system . 
once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of headed towards the bahamas . 
however , on september , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely . 
impact 
as passed to the south of the cape verde islands on september , outer rain bands produced minor rainfall , totaling around . 
inches mm . 
there were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor . 
several days after the low dissipated , the remnant moisture from brought showers and thunderstorms to st. croix where up to in . 
mm of rain fell . 
the heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding . 
no known damage was caused by the flood . 
battle of the river 
the battle of the river took place during the second world war and involved australian , new zealand and japanese forces . 
part of the wider campaign of the pacific theatre , the battle was fought in the southern sector of island . 
coming after the battle of knoll in which a strong japanese counterattack was defeated , the battle occurred in CD distinct periods between april and may , as elements of the australian brigade advanced south along the road . 
the initial phase saw the australians advance towards the river . 
following the end of the early fighting , the australian advance towards the main japanese concentration at continued as they struck out towards the and rivers . 
this continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective , away many bridges and roads upon which the australians relied for supplies . 
as the australian advance stalled , the japanese began harassing the australian line of communications , and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late july and into august , the australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards again . 
ultimately , though , the war came to an end before the final australian advance began , bringing the campaign to an end . 
background 
strategic situation 
japanese forces had landed on in early , capturing it from the small force of australians the island . 
they had subsequently developed several on the island , using it to conduct operations in the northern solomon islands and to attack the allied lines of communication between the united states , australia and the southwest pacific area . 
these bases also helped protect rabaul , the major japanese garrison and naval base in papua new guinea , and throughout , allied planners determined that was vital for the japanese base around rabaul . 
us marines conducted an amphibious landing at cape , on the western coast of the island , north of empress augusta bay , in november . 
after an initial counter attack , the us marines had been replaced by a garrison of us army troops who began consolidating their position around , establishing a strong perimeter . 
in march , the japanese launched a heavy counter attack , which was turned back with heavy casualties . 
after this , the situation on became largely static , as the japanese focused primarily on subsistence , and the us forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around . 
in late , as part of plans to free us troops up for the philippines campaign , the australian ii corps consisting of mainly militia troops under the command of lieutenant general stanley took over responsibility for allied operations on from the american xiv corps . 
australian forces began arriving on the island between november and december , initially establishing themselves around the us base at . 
due to inaccurate intelligence , mistakenly believed that the japanese forces on the island numbered just , men , and he consequently decided that the australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the japanese from in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere , rather than maintaining the defensive posture the us forces had adopted . 
however , allied estimates of japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number of japanese on the island at this time was closer to , . 
the campaign that australian planners developed entailed CD separate drives in the north , it was planned that japanese forces would be forced into the narrow peninsula and contained in the centre the seizure of pearl ridge would give the australians control of the east west avenues of approach , as well as them protection against further counter attacks , while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast and the main campaign in the south , where the bulk of the japanese forces were concentrated around . 
preliminary moves 
following the capture of pearl ridge in december , the australian brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards . 
in late march and early april , they had fought the battle of knoll after which a brief lull followed as the australians paused to shorten their supply lines . 
meanwhile , the survivors of the japanese force , heavily demoralised by their defeat , withdrew towards the river . 
the australian division was then ordered to resume its advance south , being tasked with capturing the river , while the was also included as an intermediate objective . 
japanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the australians at about , men , of which , were believed to be directly opposing the division . 
the brigade was considered to be the most experienced of the australian units on at the time and was moved up to relieve the brigade , which was in need of rest . 
under the command of brigadier the brigade consisted of CD infantry battalions as well as CD troops of tanks from the armoured regiment , engineers from the field company , a battery of CD guns from u heavy battery , field artillery from the field regiment , and a number of smaller support units . 
the infantry battalion took over responsibility for knoll replacing the infantry battalion while the infantry battalion took up a position across the road . 
the brigade third battalion the infantry battalion did not join them until the beginning of may , and so the brigade infantry battalion continued patrolling operations north of the river , in the area , until the could dispatch elements to relieve them . 
further inland , the commando squadron advanced in a wide arc to the south east , defending the brigade left , or eastern , flank . 
the japanese forces opposing the australians belonged to the division , under the command of lieutenant general . 
had been ordered to delay the australian advance between the and the for as long as possible , and with these orders in mind he had installed a number of strong points along the australian expected line of advance . 
the division infantry had suffered heavily in the previous battle around knoll and as a consequence , several units had to be reorganized or amalgamated . 
the front line positions were assigned to the field artillery regiment , while the infantry regiment was to hold CD to their rear along and the road , designated a through to e . 
the field and field heavy artillery regiments both held further back , designated f and g . 
the infantry regiment was placed in the rear , where it was being reconstituted following losses suffered during the attack on knoll . 
battle 
advance to the 
the brigade took over the forward positions from the brigade on april . 
initial had the infantry battalion on the road around creek , with the around , north east of knoll , and the , when it arrived to relieve the , would be positioned further east a secondary , parallel track known to the australians as the commando road . 
CD days later , received the order to commence the advance towards the from , who offered him the support of the brigade as a mobile reserve in case of sudden counter attack . 
in a change to the tactics that the australians had previously employed prior to the fighting around knoll , from early may they advanced on a CD battalion front , instead of CD . 
the infantry battalion was in the van , moving along the road with the protecting its flank and rear while , yd , m further inland the infantry battalion , commencing on may , advanced along the commando road from , after taking over from the infantry battalion . 
moving forward under a barrage as they moved beyond , the infantry battalion was the first to contact the japanese , carrying out an attack against japanese positions around creek on april . 
by a troop of matilda tanks from the armoured regiment , an artillery barrage which fired over shells , CD infantry companies c and d from the attacked the position while another a company carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another track further north towards and . 
the left forward company d company reached its objective without trouble however , c company on the right along with the troop of tanks came up against stiff japanese resistance and became bogged down . 
a company also became embroiled in heavy fighting along the track . 
in support of a company , came forward and raked the jungle , hacking through the to reveal several japanese , which were destroyed by the australian armour . 
as night fell , c company dug in before resuming the attack the next morning . 
engineers were brought forward , as was a , and the gap was . 
heavy fighting , the australians forced their way across the creek . 
by the time that the position had been taken in the afternoon and the infantry had advanced to the line of exploitation yd m beyond the creek , japanese had been killed for the loss of CD australians killed and wounded . 
after this , the australians continued their advance towards creek , which was a further mi . 
km to the southeast . 
in response , the japanese launched a number of determined counterattacks over the course of the following week , although these were turned back . 
during this time , the australians sent a number of patrols out in front of their forward elements , CD of which managed to slip through the japanese defensive positions either side of the road and carried out a reconnaissance of the river about , yd m south of the main crossing . 
further patrols were carried out , as well as a number of ambushes , before the advance was resumed on april . 
their advance , the australians were supported by CD squadrons of from the royal new zealand air force nos . 
, and squadrons which bombed and the ground in front of the advancing infantry , as well as a barrage of artillery and mortar fire . 
with such strong support the japanese offered little resistance and over the course of CD days the infantry battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the , for just CD man wounded . 
further progress was made over the next week , but on may the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other improvised explosive devices . 
after this , the brigade engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines . 
the japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also . 
to the effectiveness of the australian tanks , the japanese began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support . 
additionally , the japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant observation and fire . 
meanwhile , the previous day , may , the infantry battalion had begun operating along the parallel commando road to the north . 
here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling , which resulted in them being ambushed . 
they also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching , and crossing the river , arriving there on may . 
on may , along the road , the infantry battalion had pressed forward again . 
with a tank troop in support , they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately japanese . 
after the lead matilda machine gun jammed , the field gun opened fire on it , damaging it and wounding its crew . 
moving around the stricken tank , the second matilda , armed with a howitzer , opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the japanese defenders from the position . 
that night , the japanese artillery opened up on the australian position with a heavy barrage , and the following morning put in a company sized counter attack . 
the fighting lasted for over CD and a half hours , but when it was over the australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack . 
in doing so , they suffered CD killed and CD wounded , while the attacking japanese had suffered heavily , losing men killed . 
it was the biggest loss since the action at knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the . 
after this , the australians were able to resume their advance to the river on may without further opposition . 
the previous CD weeks in which they had advanced , yd , m to the had been costly for them , however , with the australian infantry battalion losing killed and wounded . 
against this , the japanese had lost at least killed . 
crossing the 
following the advance to the , there was a pause of about a week as the australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up , before attempting to cross the en . 
this allowed to re evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the and rivers . 
as they waited for the advance to resume , the australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time . 
as a part of these , the infantry battalion sent a company across the and subsequently located a strong japanese position on a feature that became known as ridge , which , due to its location , commanded the main australian axis of advance . 
the main crossing was planned for may , with the infantry battalion on the right tasked to cut the road and the track to the east of the river , while on the left the infantry battalion would divert the attention of the japanese off the infantry battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the australian line , crossing at the , advancing straight up the road . 
preliminary moves began before this , and on may a platoon from the infantry battalion along with CD tanks attempted to carry out an attack on ridge . 
after CD of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a japanese field gun , they were forced to withdraw . 
meanwhile , the squadrons now reinforced by no . 
squadron began an CD day aerial campaign , attacking along the length of the and commando roads . 
during this period , the new zealanders flew sorties , while artillery and mortars fired thousands of rounds . 
CD days later , on may , the infantry battalion began its diversionary move on the left flank , crossing the inland and advancing along the commando road with and CD batteries of artillery in support . 
crossing yd m north of the , the centre company carried out an attack along the far bank of the river without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing . 
nevertheless , shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began to fan out , carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on may . 
in the centre , the main attack along the road began at on may after minutes of by new zealand had prepared the ground . 
under a barrage , and with mortar and machine gun support , the infantry battalion moved forward with CD companies up front and CD held back in reserve , along with CD troops of matilda tanks . 
the forward companies reached their objectives , but CD of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing CD killed and CD wounded . 
the attack was resumed the following day , and the australians were able to advance to the however , they were prevented from moving any further as the japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an australian patrol encountered japanese and were forced to go to ground . 
finally , a company from the infantry battalion was able to move on to the high ground on ridge , which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped . 
engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature . 
on the right flank , the infantry battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the by . 
beginning their move CD days earlier , a number of patrols had had contacts with the japanese . 
meanwhile , using to drag the tanks through the mud , the australian armour had crossed the river also and by on may the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river , to the japanese . 
the following day , the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective , which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing , and further delayed by stiff resistance . 
later , after CD of the battalion patrols came under heavy fire , the tanks moved up and attacked a japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned , leaving behind a mm gun and a large amount of ammunition . 
by may , although there were still a number of japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications , most of the australian objectives had been secured and up operations began . 
the last remaining defensive location before the was ridge , where the japanese were sheltering in tunnels . 
a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge . 
it was subsequently occupied by a company of australian infantry . 
within a short period of time the road was subsequently opened , providing the australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign , being the advance to the , , and rivers . 
the final phase of the battle cost the japanese killed , while the australians lost killed and wounded . 
aftermath 
during the course of the fighting around the , the australians lost men killed and wounded , while the japanese lost at least men killed . 
following the battle , the australians continued their advance towards at the southern end of the island . 
throughout the remainder of the month and into june , the brigade advanced along the road , crossing the on june . 
beyond the river , the japanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply , and they consequently occupied a series of deep . 
these were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery , and the brigade subsequently crossed river before being relieved by brigadier noel simpson brigade in early july . 
as the brigade advanced toward the river , torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt . 
the height of the river rose metres . 
ft . 
the road was reduced , in the words of gavin long , to a sea of mud and many of the bridges upon which the australian supply system was dependent were washed away .

assault was repulsed with devastating losses for the attackers in what became known as the battle of the all but of the men of the first including himself were killed in the battle . 
the survivors returned to point , notified army headquarters of their defeat in the battle and awaited further reinforcements and orders from rabaul . 
by august , unit had reached and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to . 
because of the damage caused by allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the battle of the eastern , the japanese decided not to deliver troops to by slow transport ship instead , the ships carrying soldiers were sent to rabaul . 
from there , the japanese planned to deliver men to by destroyers , staging through a japanese naval base in the islands . 
the japanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down the to and back in a single night , their exposure to allied air attack . 
however , most of the soldiers heavy equipment and supplies , such as heavy artillery , vehicles , and much food and ammunition , could not be taken to with them . 
these high speed destroyer runs to , which occurred throughout the campaign , were later called the tokyo express by allied forces and rat transportation by the japanese . 
the japanese controlled the seas around the solomon islands during the nighttime and were not challenged by the allies . 
however , any japanese ship remaining within the mi km range of the aircraft at henderson field in daylight was in great danger from air attacks . 
this curious tactical situation held for several months . 
movement 
on august , of troops were loaded onto the destroyers , , , and , designated destroyer division . 
because of a shortage of fuel , could not make the entire round trip to at high speed in CD night , but had to start the trip earlier in the day so that they could complete the trip by the next morning at a slower speed which fuel . 
at that day , u.s. dive bombers from under the command of lt . 
col . 
richard , flew from henderson field and located and attacked about mi km north of , sinking and heavily damaging and . 
took in tow and the CD destroyers returned to the without completing their mission . 
the attack on killed of soldiers and crew members . 
subsequent express runs were more successful . 
between august and september , various japanese light cruisers , destroyers , and patrol boats were able to land almost , troops at point , including all of the infantry brigade , CD battalion of the regiment , and the rest of regiment . 
general , who landed at point on the august express run , was placed in command of all the japanese troops on . 
on the night of september , as CD of the express destroyers , , and prepared to shell henderson field after landing their troops , they detected and sank CD u.s. ships in the vicinity , the small , old destroyer transports called by the u.s. marines uss little and gregory that were used to allied troops around the area . 
in spite of the successes of the destroyer runs , insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to by slow barges . 
therefore , a convoy carrying , of troops and heavy equipment in barges , mainly from the battalion , infantry regiment under the command of colonel , departed the northern coast of santa isabel island on september . 
on september , aircraft from henderson field attacked the barge convoy , killing about of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit heavy equipment . 
most of the remaining , troops were able to land near s e , west of the perimeter over the next few days . 
by september , had , troops at point and , west of the perimeter . 
was confident enough that he could defeat the allied forces facing him that he declined an offer from the army for delivery of CD more infantry battalion to augment his forces . 
believed that there were only about , u.s. marines on . 
during this time , continued to direct efforts to strengthen and improve the defenses of the perimeter . 
between august and september , he relocated CD marine battalions including the battalion , under u.s. 
lieutenant colonel merritt a. 
raiders , and the parachute battalion from and to . 
these units added about , troops to original , men defending henderson field . 
the parachute battalion , which had suffered heavy casualties in the battle of and in august , was placed under command . 
battle 
prelude 
set the date for his attack on the perimeter for september and began marching his forces west from towards point on september . 
he army and requested that it carry out air strikes on henderson field beginning on september , and that naval warships be stationed off point on september to destroy any americans who attempted to flee from the island . 
on september , issued his attack plan to and the enemy in the vicinity of the island airfield . 
plan called for his forces to split into CD , approach the perimeter inland , and launch a surprise night attack . 
force would attack the perimeter from the west while second renamed the battalion would attack from the east . 
the main attack would be by center body , numbering , men in CD battalions , from the south of the perimeter . 
by september , most of troops had started marching from towards point along the coastline . 
about japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade supply base at . 
meanwhile , native island scouts directed by british government official and officer in the british solomon islands defence force , martin told the marines of japanese troops at , near the village of , about mi km east of . 
launched a raid against the japanese troops at . 
destroyer transports uss mckean and and CD patrol boats took of men to in CD trips . 
and his first wave of troops landed at at local time on september . 
by aircraft from henderson field and gunfire from the destroyer transports , men advanced towards village but were slowed by japanese resistance . 
at , the rest of men landed . 
with this reinforcement and more support from the henderson field aircraft , force pushed into the village . 
the japanese defenders , believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach of an allied supply ship convoy heading towards point , retreated into the jungle , leaving behind dead . 
CD marines were killed . 
in , troops discovered the supply base for forces , including large of food , ammunition and medical supplies , and a radio . 
the marines seized documents , equipment and food supplies , destroyed the rest , and returned to the perimeter at . 
the quantities of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least , japanese troops were on the island and apparently planning an attack . 
and colonel gerald thomas , operations officer , believed that the japanese attack would come at the ridge , a narrow , grassy , , m , yd long , coral ridge s e parallel to the river just south of henderson field . 
the ridge offered a natural of approach to the airfield , commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended . 
and thomas tried to persuade to move forces to defend the ridge , but refused , believing that the japanese were more likely to attack along the coast . 
finally , thomas convinced that the ridge was a good location for raiders to rest from their actions of the preceding month . 
on september , the men of unit including the raiders and the deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it . 
center body of troops was planning to attack the perimeter at the ridge , which they called the because of its shape . 
on september , troops left the coast at point . 
into CD columns , they marched into the jungle towards their attack points south and southeast of the airfield . 
of good maps , at least CD faulty , and thick , almost impenetrable jungle caused the japanese columns to proceed slowly and , costing a lot of time . 
at the same time , troops approached the perimeter from the west . 
had some intelligence on the marine defenses , extracted from a u.s. army pilot captured on august . 
during the day of september , troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night attacks . 
wanted his CD center body battalions in place by , but they did not reach their assembly areas until after . 
was also delayed in his advance towards the marine lines in the west . 
only the battalion reported that they were in place on time . 
despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions , was still confident in his attack plan because a captured u.s. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the marine defenses . 
japanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on september , causing a few casualties , including CD killed . 
first night action 
the americans knew of the approach of the japanese forces from reports from native scouts and their own patrols , but did not know exactly where or when they would attack . 
the ridge around which deployed his men consisted of CD distinct . 
at the southern tip and surrounded on CD sides by thick jungle was hill so named because it rose ft CD above sea level . 
CD CD yards north was hill ft m high , the dominant feature on the ridge . 
the was unnamed and about ft m high . 
placed the CD companies from the battalion on the west side of the ridge and the CD parachute battalion companies on the east side , holding positions in depth from hill back to hill . 
CD of the CD companies , b and c , held a line between the ridge , a small , swampy , and the river . 
machine gun teams from e company , the heavy weapons company , were scattered throughout the defenses . 
placed his command post on hill . 
at on september , the japanese cruiser and CD destroyers shelled the perimeter for minutes and illuminated the ridge with a . 
japanese artillery began shelling the marine lines , but did little damage . 
at the same time , scattered groups of troops began with marines around the ridge . 
battalion led by major attacked the c company between the and the river , overrunning at least CD platoon and forcing the marine company to fall back to the ridge . 
unit became entangled with troops from battalion under lieutenant colonel , who were still struggling to reach their attack positions , and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the japanese attack on the ridge that night . 
, who was having trouble locating where he was in relation to the u.s. marine lines as well as coordinating his troops attacks , later complained , due to the jungle , the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control . 
in my whole life i have never felt so disappointed and helpless . 
CD u.s. marines were killed japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater . 
although both in the west and the unit in the east tried to attack the marine lines that night , they failed to make contact and halted near the marine lines at dawn . 
at first light on september , air force aircraft and marine artillery fired into the area just south of the ridge , forcing any japanese out in the open to seek cover in the nearby jungle . 
the japanese suffered several casualties , including CD officers from battalion . 
at , decided to regroup his forces for another attack that night . 
second night action on the ridge 
the japanese to attack again that night , directed his troops to improve their defenses on and around the ridge . 
after a failed attempt by CD companies to retake the ground on the marine right flank lost to the night before , his forces . 
he pulled his front back about yd m to a line that stretched , yd , m , starting at the river and crossing the ridge about yd m south of hill . 
around and behind hill he placed CD companies . 
any japanese attackers hill would have to advance over yd m of open terrain to close with the marine positions at hill . 
with only a few hours to prepare , the marines were only able to construct rudimentary and shallow fortifications . 
they were low on ammunition , with CD or CD grenades for each marine . 
ordered a reserve force consisting of the battalion , marine regiment to move into a position just to the rear of troops . 
in addition , a battery of CD howitzers from the marine regiment moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge , and a forward artillery observer was placed with front line units . 
late in the afternoon , stepped onto a grenade box and addressed his exhausted troops , saying , you men have done a great job , and i have just CD more thing to ask of you . 
out just CD more night . 
i know we ve been without sleep a long time . 
but we expect another attack from them tonight and they may come through here . 
i have every reason to believe that we will have reliefs here for all of us in the morning . 
speech raised the spirits of the raiders and helped them prepare mentally for the night ahead . 
as the sun set on september , faced marines with , troops of his brigade , plus an assortment of light artillery . 
the night was pitch black , with no moon . 
at , CD japanese destroyers briefly bombarded the ridge . 
attack began just after nightfall , with battalion assaulting company b on the marine right flank , just to the west of the ridge . 
the force of the assault caused company b to fall back to hill . 
under marine artillery fire , reassembled his men and continued his attack . 
without to try to roll up the other nearby marine units , whose flanks were now unprotected , unit forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the river , heading for the airfield . 
men came upon a pile of marine supplies and rations . 
not having eaten adequately for a couple of days , they paused to themselves on the c and k rations . 
ordered his men to continue the attack . 
at about , he led them against the marine units around the northern portion of the ridge , just short of the airfield , as well as hill . 
in the heavy fighting that followed , and around of his men were killed , ending that attack . 
meanwhile , battalion , under major tamura , assembled for their planned assault against hill from the jungle south of the ridge . 
marine observers spotted tamura preparations and called in artillery fire . 
at about , a barrage from CD mm . 
in guns hit tamura position . 
in response , CD companies of tamura troops numbering about men charged up hill with fixed bayonets behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenades . 
tamura attack hit company b of the marine parachute battalion and also company b , pushing the off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the . 
to protect the exposed company b , immediately ordered them to pull back onto hill . 
at the same time , a japanese company from battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side of the ridge and parachute company c. that their positions were now , parachute companies b and c climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind hill . 
in the darkness and confusion of the battle , the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized . 
a few marines began that the japanese were attacking with poison gas , other marines who no longer possessed their gas masks . 
after arriving behind hill , some of the marines continued on towards the airfield , repeating the word withdraw to anyone within . 
other marines began to follow them . 
just at the moment that it appeared that the marines on the hill were about to break and head for the rear in a , , major kenneth d. bailey from staff , and other marine officers appeared and , with vivid language , the marines back into defensive positions around hill . 
as the marines formed into a shaped line around hill , tamura battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill , charging up the saddle from hill and up from below the east side of the ridge . 
under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least CD japanese , the marines repulsed the first CD attacks by tamura men . 
tamura troops a mm . 
in regimental gun to the top of hill in an effort to fire it directly at the marines . 
this gun , which could have turned the tide in favor of the japanese , however , was disabled by a faulty firing pin . 
at midnight , during a short lull in the fighting , ordered parachute companies b and c to advance from behind hill to strengthen his left flank . 
with fixed bayonets , the swept forward , killing japanese soldiers who had overrun the marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the marine lines from the flank , and took position on the east side of the hill . 
marines from other units , as well as members of command staff , including major bailey , took ammunition and grenades under fire to the marines around hill , who were running critically low . 
said marine participant captain william j. 
, the japanese attack was almost constant , like a rain that for a moment and then the harder ... 
when CD wave was down and i mean down another followed it into death . 
the japanese hit left flank just after the took position but were again stopped by marine rifle , machine gun , mortar , and grenade fire . 
marine mm and CD artillery was also taking a heavy toll on the attacking japanese . 
a captured japanese soldier later said that his unit was annihilated by the marine artillery fire , which only of his company survived . 
by , after several more assaults , some of which resulted in hand to hand fighting , and severe sniper fire from all sides , men were joined by troops from the battalion , marine regiment , who helped repulse CD more japanese attacks before dawn . 
throughout the night , as men came close to overrunning the marine defenses , remained standing about yd m behind the marine firing line on hill , his troops and directing their defensive efforts . 
said marine captain smith , who was in position to observe for most of the night , i can say that if there is such a thing as CD man holding a battalion together , did it that night . 
he stood just behind the front lines stood , when most of us the ground . 
during the heavy fighting , portions of CD japanese companies , including CD from tamura and CD from battalions , the marine defenses on the ridge , while suffering heavy losses from marine gunfire , and reached the edge of fighter one , a secondary runway of henderson field . 
a counterattack by the marine engineers stopped CD japanese company advances and forced it to retreat . 
the other CD companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield . 
when no reinforcements joined them , both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after . 
most of the rest of battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night . 
as the sun rose on september , pockets of japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge . 
but with tamura battalion shattered after losing of its officers and men , and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well , assault on the ridge had effectively ended . 
about japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of hill , perhaps preparing for CD more charge on hill . 
at first light , CD u.s. army aircraft from the fighter squadron at henderson field , acting on a request personally delivered by bailey , the japanese near hill and killed most of them , with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle . 
and attacks 
as the battle on the ridge took place , and units also attacked the marine defenses on the east and west sides of the perimeter . 
the battalion led by major takeshi attacked the southeastern sector of the perimeter , defended by marines of the battalion , marine regiment . 
attack started around midnight , with CD company attacking through marine artillery fire and engaging in hand to hand combat with the marine defenders before being thrown back . 
was killed in the attack . 
after , the marines , believing that the rest of battalion was still in the area , sent forward CD light tanks without infantry support to sweep the area in front of the marine lines CD japanese mm . 
in anti tank guns destroyed or disabled CD of them . 
after abandoning their burning tanks , several of the disabled tanks were and killed by the japanese . 
CD tank down an embankment into the river , drowning its crew . 
at on september , the remnants of the battalion conducted another attack on the same portion of the marine lines , but were repulsed . 
a final weak attack by the unit on the evening of september was also defeated . 
unit of about men attacked the marines at several locations on the west side of the perimeter . 
at about on september , CD japanese companies attacked positions held by the battalion , marine regiment near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses . 
another japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of september . 
the rest of unit failed to find the marine lines and did not participate in the attack . 
aftermath 
at on september , led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle , where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day . 
units were then ordered to withdraw west to the river valley to join with unit , a mi . 
km march over difficult terrain . 
troops began the march on the morning of september . 
almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded . 
as the march progressed , the exhausted and hungry soldiers , who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal , began to their heavy equipment and then their rifles . 
by the time most of them reached positions at CD days later , only half still carried their weapons . 
the battalion survivors , attempting to follow center body forces , became lost , wandered for CD weeks in the jungle , and almost to death before finally reaching camp .

with the of the general headquarters ordered his troops on new guinea , who were within mi km of their objective of port moresby to withdraw until the matter was resolved . 
the japanese were never able to restart their drive towards port moresby the defeat at ridge contributed not only to japan defeat in the campaign , but also to japan ultimate defeat throughout the south pacific .

plot 
though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in the moving picture world from september , . 
it states life in a country town is often tedious and , and were it not for the little and the are constantly given , existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed . 
so the time honored get of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay . 
the thought well of this established feature . 
they made it a occasion for themselves as well as their guests . 
they were hardly an overly wealthy family , and their table was never notable for an of the good things of life , but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the CD end that their guests have a pleasant time . 
on the night before such an event neither , , or gale could get those minutes solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests comfort . 
at the first of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the into shape . 
so little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured when the prize dish was a splendid the were ever looking after the need of the said . 
first gale would to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state , and give it a stir then gale would over and give it a stir finally gale would have to come over and honor it likewise . 
then arrived the guests . 
the minister and the mrs. minister , they were , and some neighbors . 
while she was receiving them the recollection came to gale that the beloved had not received its . 
off she speeds to a of whiskey in the kitchen . 
she into the the right proportion of liquor , and goes back to her guests . 
then gale remembers that the has not been flavored . 
he , too , himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred . 
no sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than gale , who has just remembered about the forgotten , rushes in and makes for the whiskey . 
she the right proportion in , too .

the film director is unknown , but it may have been barry o neil . 
film historian q. david bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at least CD possible candidates exist .

the role of the cameraman was in productions . 
the cast credits are unknown , but many thanhouser productions are fragmentary .

the the moving picture world reviewer found the subject to be too long , but did not find it to be a fault . 
the reviewer states , a domestic comedy with a different flavor . 
in fact , with a for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook , the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of , neither CD knowing that the others have done likewise . 
the humor in this piece centers around this . 
what happened to the guests who of it certainly draws upon the imagination . 
imagine CD people , not to speak of the cat , getting drunk on the brandy in CD 
: we do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week . 
as well as were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters . 
the episode was well done , which is the faint praise that we do not like to out to anyone . 
walton of the moving picture news was not by the plot and stated , to me the last scene had no humor . 
it was only the necessary ending to the beginning . 
true humor does not from . 
the new york dramatic mirror stated , this is the old story of too many cooks , and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way . 
the early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation . 
NFP a weak point in the story is the fact that the is cut into CD small pieces , making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power . 
CD would have been as easy to make as CD and would have been more convincing . 
the character parts are all well taken , although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera .

early life and education 
churchill was born in , illinois , to jack churchill and allen . 
his parents divorced before he was CD , and he grew up in , where he attended local schools . 
in , he was drafted into the united states army . 
on his resume , he said he served as a public information specialist who wrote and edited the battalion and wrote news releases . 
in a profile on churchill , the denver post reported that he was drafted , went to paratrooper school , then volunteered for vietnam , where he served a month tour as long range reconnaissance patrol , CD of a CD man team sent out to track down the enemy . 
the post article also reported that churchill was politically as a result of his experiences in vietnam . 
churchill told the post that he had spent some time at the chicago office of the students for a democratic society in the late , and briefly taught members of the weather underground how to build bombs and fire weapons . 
in , the denver post reported that churchill military records show he was trained as a film and light truck driver , but they do not reflect paratrooper school or training . 
the ranger regiment association found no record of churchill having been a member of the unit , or a team . 
churchill received his in technological communications in and in communications theory in , both from state university , now the university of illinois at springfield . 
career 
in , churchill began working at the university of colorado boulder as an action officer in the university administration . 
he also on american indian issues in the ethnic studies program . 
in , the university of colorado hired him as an associate professor , although he did not possess the academic doctorate usually required for the position . 
the following year he was granted tenure in the communications department , without the usual CD year period , after having been declined by the sociology and political science departments . 
he has long been interested in issues associated with the act , which broke up the communal reservation lands and assigned plots to individual households . 
with that was the federal government first use of blood quantum to define individual membership in tribes , for what became known as the rolls . 
since re establishing self governments , recognized tribes have established their own criteria for enrollment as members , often related to descent from recognized historical lists , but less often requiring proofs of blood quantum . 
some of his published works address these issues , which he has interpreted as part of the federal government policy of against native americans . 
in churchill discussed his views with david in an interview you could say that CD CD years ago was the basis of blood quantum in america . 
but in anglo america , while there was some preoccupation with it , it was not formalized until the passage of the general act , mid . 
at that point they began to define indian as being someone who was and of at least CD quarter by quantum blood indigenous in a given group . 
you couldn t be an eighth cheyenne and an eighth and be an indian . 
you had to be a quarter cheyenne or a quarter or hopefully a quarter and a quarter . 
the reason for this was quite clear . 
they were identifying indians for purposes of them individual of land in the existing reservation base at that point . 
if they ran out of indians identifiable as such , then the rest of the land would be declared surplus . 
so it was clearly in the interests of the government to create a definition of that would minimize the number of indians that were available . 
it was an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criteria to in the first place . 
it become increasingly so ever since .

interview with ward churchill historical and current . 
z magazine . 
in , churchill moved to the new studies department of the university of colorado . 
in , he was promoted to full professor . 
he was selected as chairman of the department in june . 
in january , during the controversy over his remarks , churchill resigned as chairman of the ethnic studies department at the university of colorado his term as chair was scheduled to in june of that year . 
on may , , the committee of the standing committee on research at the university of colorado concluded that churchill had committed multiple counts of academic , specifically plagiarism , fabrication , and . 
on july , , churchill was fired for academic in an CD to CD vote by the university of colorado board of . 
and affiliation 
in , churchill stated , i am myself of and creek descent on my father side , on my mother , and am an enrolled member of the united band of indians . 
in , churchill wrote elsewhere that he is CD eighth creek and CD sixteenth . 
in , churchill told the colorado daily that he was CD sixteenth creek and . 
churchill told the denver post in february that he is CD . 
in a statement dated may , , and posted on its website , the united band initially said , the united band would like to make it clear that mr. churchill a member of the band and was only given an honorary associate membership in the early because he could not prove any ancestry . 
the tribe said that all of churchill past , present and future claims or of enrollment , written or spoken , including but not limited to biographies , curriculum , lectures , applications for employment , or any other reference not listed , are deemed by the united band . 
CD days later , the united band replaced its statement and acknowledged churchill alleged ancestry of being because mr. churchill had genealogical information regarding his alleged ancestry , and his willingness to assist the in promoting the tribe and its causes , he was awarded an associate as an honor , the tribe website now said . 
however , mr. churchill may possess eligibility status for nation of oklahoma , since he claims . 
the tribe spokesperson , lisa , stated the tribe only members with certified CD quarter american indian blood . 
the website statement further clarified that churchill was not eligible for tribal membership due to the fact that he does not possess a certificate of of indian blood , and the associate membership did not an individual to voting rights or enrollment in the tribe . 
churchill has never asked for certification , and finds the idea of being by the us government offensive . 
in june , the united band had voted to stop associate . 
such honorary associate membership recognizes an individual assistance to the tribe , but it has nothing to do with indian ancestry , and it does not an individual to vote in the tribe as a member . 
the band states that churchill still holds the associate membership and it has not been rescinded .

numerous members of churchill extended family have longstanding family legends of indian ancestry among ancestors but , none was confirmed among the direct forebears of churchill who were identified . 
in churchill university personnel file show that he was granted tenure in a special opportunity position . 
in , then boulder chancellor james refused to take action on allegations that churchill was claiming to be an indian , saying it has always been university policy that a person race or ethnicity is self proving . 
some of churchill native american critics , such as vernon white earth ojibwe and southern cheyenne creek , argue that his assertion of native american ancestry without the ability to prove it might constitute and grounds for termination . 
the university has said that it does not hire on the basis of ethnicity . 
the university of colorado research committee conducted a preliminary investigation into whether churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to add credibility and public acceptance to his scholarship . 
the committee concluded that the allegation was not appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research . 
in a interview in the rocky mountain news , churchill said , i have never been confirmed as having CD quarter blood , and never said i was . 
and even if the critics are absolutely right , what does that have to do with this issue 
i have never claimed to be bull .

homarus gammarus 
homarus gammarus , known as the european lobster or common lobster , is a species of lobster from the eastern atlantic ocean , mediterranean sea and parts of the black sea . 
it is closely related to the american lobster , h. americanus . 
it may grow to a length of cm in and a mass of kilograms lb , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws . 
in life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming lobster red on cooking . 
mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into larvae . 
homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the british isles . 
description 
homarus gammarus is a large , with a body length up to centimetres in and weighing up to kilograms lb , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually cm in long and weigh . 
. 
kg . 
. 
lb . 
like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called . 
this may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every years for larger animals . 
the first pair of is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws . 
the larger one is the , and has rounded used for crushing prey the other is the cutter , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey . 
usually , the left claw is the , and the right is the cutter . 
the is generally blue above , with spots that , and yellow below . 
the red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . 
this occurs because , in life , the red pigment is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment . 
the closest relative of h. gammarus is the american lobster , homarus americanus . 
the CD species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap . 
the CD species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics the of h. americanus bears CD or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in h. gammarus . 
the spines on the claws of h. americanus are red or red tipped , while those of h. gammarus are white or white tipped . 
the underside of the claw of h. americanus is orange or red , while that of h. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red . 
life cycle 
female h. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of millimetres . 
. 
in , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size . 
mating typically occurs in summer between a recently female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard shelled male . 
the female carries the eggs for up to months , depending on the temperature , attached to her . 
females carrying eggs are said to be and can be found throughout the year . 
the eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on . 
this stage involves CD and lasts for days . 
after the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a lifestyle . 
the juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows . 
it is estimated that only larva in every , survives to the phase . 
when they reach a carapace length of mm . 
in , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives . 
distribution 
homarus gammarus is found across the north eastern atlantic ocean from northern norway to the azores and morocco , not including the baltic sea . 
it is also present in most of the mediterranean sea , only missing from the section east of crete , and along only the north west coast of the black sea . 
the populations are found in the norwegian and , inside the arctic circle . 
the species can be divided into CD genetically distinct populations , CD widespread population , and CD which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment .
