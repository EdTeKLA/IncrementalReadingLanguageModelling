# GAMM Model Checking

The figures in this directory show plots of the residuals for the GAMM base models for each participant group. 

Plots for the full models were omitted because they were visually indistinguishable from those for the base models for each language background. 

The plots show approximately normally distributed residuals with some deviation from normality at the tails of the distributions.
